How does the ontology-based framework developed for constructing knowledge graphs from the GDELT dataset improve question-answering capabilities compared to traditional text-based Retrieval Augmented Generation approaches?,"['Abstract In this work we study various Retrieval Augmented Regeneration (RAG) approaches to gain an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in a question-answering analysis. To gain this understanding we use a case-study subset of the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) dataset as well as a corpus of raw text scraped from the online news articles. To retrieve information from the text corpus we implement a traditional vector store RAG as well as state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) based approaches for automatically constructing KGs and retrieving the relevant subgraphs. In addition to these corpus approaches, we develop a novel ontology-based framework for constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from GDELT directly which leverages the underlying schema of GDELT to create structured representations of global events. For retrieving relevant information from the ontology-based KGs we implement both direct graph queries and state-of-the-art graph retrieval approaches. We compare the performance of each method in a question-answering task.

Conversely, LLM-generated KGs, while capturing event summaries, often lack consistency and interpretability. Our findings suggest benefits of a synergistic approach between ontology and LLM-based KG construction, with proposed avenues toward that end. 1 Introduction In this work we study several approaches for communicating with a corpus of text via relevant text and knowledge graph (KG) representation and retrieval facilitated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our goal is to understand the benefits and drawbacks of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches to corpus management and anlysis when combined with an LLM. Throughout we use as a case study a novel KG derived from the Global Data on Events, Location, and Tone (GDELT)1 [13] dataset. As a way to enhance LLM outputs, researchers and practitioners have been quick in applying LLMs to query and understand proprietary data through retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) [14]. It has been shown that reasoning over the typical RAG framework, which only takes advantage of the unstructured text articles, fails to capture global information about the provided data [5, 27]. Motivated by this limitation, there has been recent interest in adapting these techniques to the case where our data has a graph structure, so that the LLM can directly ingest important relationships in the knowledge base [5, 7, 15, 31]. More specifically, KGs [8] are graph structures which are richly attributed with typing and semantic information on both nodes and edges. KG techniques provide ways to automatically query and extract information stored in a KG without the user explicitly needing to understand query languages to probe their knowledge base. Typically, these AI-based search algorithms find subgraphs that can be used to answer a user-provided query. The interactions between KGs and LLMs have potential beyond merely question-answering and knowledge extraction (see different research directions outlined by Pan et al. [18]). In particular, reflective of KGs being used to enhance LLM outputs, LLMs can be used to enhance existing KGs or create new ones entirely from scratch.

1. **Structured Representation Leveraging GDELT Schema**:  
   The ontology-based framework uses the underlying schema of the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph edition 2 (GKG2) to create a richly structured KG (referred to as the DKG). This KG accurately reflects the relational database structure of GDELT in graph form, with well-defined node and edge types based on a lightweight ontology. This contrasts with traditional RAG approaches that rely on unstructured text or loosely structured data, which may miss or obscure important relationships.

2. **Improved Accuracy and Interpretability**:  
   Because the ontology-based KG adheres to a prescribed schema, it provides consistent and interpretable relationships between entities and events. This leads to more precise answers in question-answering tasks, especially for complex or quantitative queries (e.g., ""How many articles did CNN publish about the Baltimore bridge collapse?"") that traditional text-based RAG struggles to answer accurately.

3. **Direct Graph Querying Capability**:  
   The ontology-based KG allows for direct graph queries that can precisely extract relevant subgraphs or facts without requiring the LLM to infer or hallucinate relationships. This direct querying often yields ground-truth answers or near-exact information, which is difficult to achieve with text-based retrieval that depends on similarity matching and may miss structured context.

4. **Challenges with LLM-Generated KGs**:  
   The study found that KGs generated automatically by LLMs from raw text (LKG and GRKG) often lack the strict ontological structure, leading to inconsistencies, entity resolution problems (e.g., duplicate nodes for the same entity), and isolated nodes. These issues reduce the quality and reliability of answers derived from such KGs compared to the ontology-based KG.

5. **Quantitative and Qualitative Performance Gains**:  
   Empirical results show that methods leveraging the ontology-based KG (DKG), including direct graph queries and graph retrieval (G-Retriever), generally outperform traditional vector store RAG and LLM-generated KG approaches in semantic similarity to ground truth answers. This demonstrates the practical advantage of the ontology-based framework in producing more accurate and relevant answers.

6. **Synergistic Potential**:  
   While the ontology-based KG excels in structure and accuracy, automated extraction of relevant subgraphs remains challenging. Conversely, LLM-generated KGs capture event summaries but lack consistency. The paper suggests that combining ontology-based and LLM-based KG construction methods could leverage the strengths of both, further enhancing question-answering capabilities.

**In summary**, the ontology-based framework improves question-answering by providing a well-structured, semantically rich KG directly derived from GDELT’s schema, enabling precise graph queries and more accurate, interpretable answers than traditional text-based RAG approaches that rely on unstructured or loosely structured data.","['arXiv:2503.07584v3  [cs.IR]  24 Jun 2025\nTalking to GDELT Through Knowledge Graphs\nAudun Myers, Max Vargas, Sinan G.

 'stores reveals that the LLM independently recognizes Brandon Scott as the mayor of Baltimore. For all\nother questions, the language model cannot answer the posed questions by itself due to the recency of the\nbridge collapse.\nTo quantitatively evaluate the quality of the answers generated by our different question-answering methods,\nwe require a set of ground truth answers for the questions posed. Table 2 presents these manually curated\nground truth answers, representing the expected correct responses for each question used in our evalua-\ntion. These ground truth answers serve as the benchmark against which the performance of each system is\nmeasured.\nQuestion\nGround Truth\nWhat is the name of the Bridge that collapsed and\nwhat river was it on?\nThe Francis Scott Key Bridge on the Patapsco River.\nWhat is the name of the ship that collided with the\nbaltimore bridge?\nThe ship was named the Dali.\nHow many articles did CNN publish about the Bal-\ntimore bridge collapse?\nCNN published 5 articles.\nOn what date did the Baltimore Bridge collapse?\nThe collapse occurred on March 26, 2024.\nWho is Brandon Scott?\nBrandon Scott is the Mayor of Baltimore.\nWho is Niki Fennoy?\nNiki Fennoy is a city police spokesman.\nWhat are the top themes present in the data?\nThemes include maritime incidents, manmade disaster, and\nwater-related topics.\nTable 2: Ground Truth Answers for the Baltimore Bridge Collapse Questions\nTo further validate our qualitative findings, Figure 5 presents a quantitative comparison of the semantic\nsimilarity of answers generated by the five different methods when querying the GDELT dataset related\nto the Baltimore bridge collapse. We compute the quality of the result by calculating cosine similarity5, a\nmeasure of the similarity between the embeddings of the predicted answer and the ground truth, with higher\nvalues indicating greater accuracy. The box plots illustrate the distribution of these similarity scores for each\nmethod: Graph Query on DKG, G-Retriever on DKG, RAG using Vector Store, G-Retriever on LKG, and\nGraphRAG Q&A on GRKG. As our qualitative analysis suggested, methods leveraging direct graph queries\non the DKG, standard RAG with a vector store, and GraphRAG Q&A on the GRKG generally exhibit the\nhighest cosine similarity scores, providing quantitative evidence for their superior performance in generating\naccurate and relevant answers compared to the G-Retriever, especially with the LKG. This visualization\nquantitatively confirms the trends observed in the qualitative evaluation presented in Table 1.\n4\nConclusion\nThis work has taken the GDELT GKG database and introduced an ontology to create a knowledge graph\nwith rich structure. We found that while the large KG produced by the GDELT-GKG2 database has rich\ninformation for question-answering, the ad hoc techniques for graph exploration deem further investigation\nfor reliable use. That said, the information stored in the KG produced here is not without flaws, and we\nexpect the example studied here to be useful for the broader synergy between KGs and LLMs as addressed\nby others [18]. While the KGs produced using LlamaIndex captured a summary of the events surrounding\nthe Baltimore bridge collapse, the quality of the resulting structure was not suitable for question-answering.\nThose techniques incorporated into the GraphRAG package did considerably better, but there is room for\nimprovement for answering global questions, resolving duplicate entities, and incorporating ontologically-\nguided relation extraction. We believe the incorporation of the ontology into the relation extraction will\nhave the benefit of allowing tools such as GraphRAG to better answer quantitative questions that only the\nontology based KG pipeline (DKG) was able to answer (e.g., the number of articles published on a topic).\nLarge language models continue to be adapted to solve problems across domains, and the case study on the\nKG built here presents much opportunity for future development. In particular, the debate around using\n5The\nsemantic\nembeddings\nused\nto\ncalculate\nthe\ncosine\nsimilarity\nwere\ngenerated\nusing\nthe\nsentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from the Sentence Transformers library.\n9'
 'we have five pipelines on how we implement an LLM for talking to GDELT. These pipelines are shown\nin Fig. 1, where in each case, we use an LLM to produce a final answer from the information obtained\nfrom each retrieval method. We note that this final processing is done with models with 7-8B parameters.\nWith the GraphRAG pipeline we use Llama-3-8B [22] for question answering, and in all other cases we use\nMistral-7B [10] in tandem with the E5-large-v2 [25] embedding model. In order, left to right:\n1. Extract knowledge using direct graph queries to probe the DKG. This method requires an analyst to\nconvert a natural language question into a suitable graph query. Consistent with other techniques, we\nthen use an LLM to interpret and repackage the retrieved information.\n2. Use G-retriever to automatically fetch a subgraph of the GDELT Knowledge Graph from a natural\nlanguage question. This subgraph retrieval algorithm requires vectorizing the nodes and edges of the\nknowledge graph using a language embedding model. Once retrieved, the subgraph is fed into an LLM\nfor interpretation.\n3. Construct a knowledge graph by parsing full-text documents (scraped from GDELT URLs) with an\nLLM and LlamaIndex’s functionality. We then proceed as in (2).\n4. Create a Vector Store using the text Corpus and ask questions in a typical RAG setting. This in-\nvolves using a language embedding model to vectorize text articles (after splitting them into 500-token\nchunks). Given a question, we use the same embedding model to vectorize it and, using the Euclidean\nmetric to identify nearby vectors, extract the most similar text snippets. The original question and its\nassociated context are then fed into an LLM to process an answer.\n5. Build a knowledge graph as in (3), using the GraphRAG ecosystem. We also use the provided question-\nanswering capabilities of the GraphRAG package.\nWe note that it is typically unnecessary to use an LLM in method (1) and the answer can often be inferred\nafter seeing the raw output of the graph query. In this case, the LLM effectively repackages the result of the\ngraph query in an expected way. As such, we view this first method as a ‘ground-truth’ on the constructed\nKG. Tautologically, if the DKG can be used to answer a question, then a suitable graph query is able to\nextract the correct answer. Conversely, if the KG cannot be used to answer a given question, then a suitable\ngraph query can prove that the answer cannot be found in the KG.\nIt is worth noting why we only employ graph queries on the DKG and not those constructed using LlamaIndex\nor GraphRAG. As noted in our empirical observations of the LLM-produced knowledge graphs, these graphs\nhave far less structure than GDELT itself. This lack of defined structure makes it difficult to form useful\nand interesting graph queries.\n3.3\nResults\nTable 1 shows a sample of questions that were passed through each of the five pipelines from Fig. 1. Exact\nqueries to the GDELT knowledge graph were generated by searching for keywords in the edge triples com-\nprising the knowledge graph. Specifically, we searched for keywords in these triples by converting each triple\nto a sentence (stored as a string) and searching therein. We then used the edge induced subgraph from the\nedge sentences where keywords were found. The following keywords were used for each question:\n• What is the name of the Bridge that collapsed and what river was it on?: Bridge, Collapse, River\n• What is the name of the ship that collided with the baltimore bridge?: Ship, Collide, Baltimore, Bridge\n• How many articles did CNN published about the baltimore bridge collapse?: CNN, Baltimore, Bridge,\nCollapse\n• On what date did the Baltimore Bridge collapse?: Date, Baltimore, Bridge, Collapse\n• Who is Brandon Scott?: Brandon Scott\n• Who is Niki Fennoy?: Niki Fennoy\n• What are the top themes present in the data?: Has Theme\n7'

The\nresults are shown in Fig. 4b. This pipeline also struggles with entity and relation resolutions, for example\ncreating separate nodes for ‘Container ship’ and ‘Container ship.’\nThe construction of the GRKG required a language model whose context window exceeded the capabilities\nof Mixtral-8x7B. We decided to use Llama-3.1-8B [22] for this case. It is worth noting that GraphRAG\nindiscriminately generates relations without the prescription of any ontology.\nIt does, however, identify\na specified set of entities with defaults being “organizations”, “persons”, “geo(locations)”, and “events.”\nSimilar to the LlamaIndex pipeline, GraphRAG struggles with entity resolution — an example of which\ncan be seen from the existence of separate nodes for “DALI” and “THE DALI.” It also spawns many small\ncomponents, often being isolated nodes; 435 of 968 total nodes are isolated in this example.\n3.2\nKnowledge Graph Analysis Methodology\nThe three graphs in Fig. 4 show the significant size difference between the DKG, LKG, and GRKG. This is\npotentially due to the summarizing nature of LlamaIndex and GraphRAG to only capture the key edges and\nnodes. Further, we find that the LLM used to create the LKG had considerable trouble with adhering to\nthe prescribed ontology, creating many new edge types outside those originally prescribed. For example, the\nLLM creates a triple (Maersk, Chartered, Container ship) when using LlamaIndex. While factually\ncorrect, the Chartered edge type is not specified in the LLM prompt. Even though the LLM struggles\nto adhere to our proposed structures, many of the edges that are mined from the article text are easily\ninterpretable.\nTo validate the quality of our ontology and to show some of its use cases in an automatic way we provide\na qualitative comparison where we use an LLM for question-answering on the GDELT dataset.

 '[23, 28].\nThroughout this work we use the GDELT dataset as a case study.\nGDELT is a massive collection of\nnews reports that provide a real-time computational record of global events that is published every 15\nminutes. It aggregates information from various news sources, blogs, and social media platforms to construct\na large collection of data including information on people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions.\nEssentially, GDELT offers a snapshot of the world’s collective events, enabling researchers and analysts to\nexplore complex patterns and relationships within global society. By analyzing this data, it’s possible to\nidentify emerging trends, assess risks, understand public sentiment, and track the evolution of various issues\nover time. The applications of GDELT are diverse and far-reaching. Some of the most common use cases\nincluding event monitoring [16, 17, 29], risk assessment and prediction [6, 19, 20, 24, 26, 30], and social\nscience research [2, 3, 4, 12].\nGDELT describes its structure as a Global Knowledge Graph (GKG, specifically, we use the the Global\nKnowledge Graph edition 2 (GKG2) of GDELT). But in fact GDELT-GKG2 is implemented as multiple\nlinked tables recording information about the relationship between articles and events, and thus effectively\nhas the structure of a relational database. Another important contribution of this paper is to actually realize\nGKG2 properly in the mathematical form of a KG, effectively a graph database, derived from and consistent\nwith its native relational database form. To facilitate this effort, we have identified a lightweight ontology\nfor GDELT in the form of its graph schema, realizing its relational database schema in a KG form.\nUsing the KG that we construct from the GDELT-GKG2 dataset, we provide a case study to explore the\nutility of LLM-based tools to extract information and confirm that the KG can be used for question-answering\nin cases where traditional RAG fails. As part of our analysis, we compare to KGs produced from processing\nvarious news articles with an LLM, prompting it to try and adhere to a reduced version of the same ontology.\nThe current state of neurosymbolic work is noted for the plethora of experimental architectures available.\nWhile details are explicated below in Section 3.2, we preview ours in Figure 1, including the five method-\nological pathways which are quantitatively compared: 1) graph queries on the KG (called the DKG) derived\n“directly” from GKG2; 2) use of G-Retriever2 [7] against the same DKG; 3) RAG against a vector store\nrepresentation of GKG2; 4) G-Retriever against a second KG (called the LKG) derived from using Llamain-\ndex3 [1] against the GDELT source articles; and 5) GraphRAG4 Q&A deployed against a third KG (called\nGRKG) using Microsoft’s open-source GraphRAG package with default configuration parameters.\nFigure 1: Pipeline of different experiments ran to analyze the GDELT database using an LLM.\n2https://github.com/XiaoxinHe/G-Retriever\n3https://www.llamaindex.ai/\n4https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/\n2']"
What is the main advatage of GDELT GKG Versoin 2.1 for knowlege graph analysis?,"['INTRODUCTION This codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands GDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards actually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news. It applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to compute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document. To sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening around the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every single day. It has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system on November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an incredible number and diversity of fields. The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent dimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly unimaginable new applications. We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and capabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we are both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original alpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. Due to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create a raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of software packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely complex analytic needs in a single file. Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for direct import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated preprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to extract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package. Thus, users may require more advanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance may be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and network and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook. Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, or other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and size (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in these formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file format needed. The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab- delimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized streamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG. Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, despite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or “.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. The new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards compatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but']","GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1 expands the ability to quantify global human society by representing latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of global news. It connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event into a massive network capturing what’s happening worldwide, its context, involved parties, and global sentiment daily. Version 2.1 integrates new features based on community interest and moves the GKG into production status, supporting a wide array of complex analytic needs in a single raw output format that can be processed with scripting languages like PERL or Python for advanced analysis.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer,"The main advantage of GDELT GKG Version 2.1 for knowledge graph analysis is that it no longer clusters multiple articles with identical metadata into a single entry. Instead, each document is represented as a separate entry in the GKG stream. This change allows for more granular and precise analysis because:

- It accommodates the new GCAM system that assesses over 2,300 emotions and themes per article, which can vary significantly even if the articles share the same locations, themes, people, and organizations.
- It supports real-time translation and provenance tracking at the document level.
- It relaxes the minimum inclusion criteria, allowing articles without any geographic mentions (previously required) to be included if they contain any extracted information, such as emotional/thematic scores.

This results in a richer, more detailed, and structurally consistent dataset that better supports detailed knowledge graph construction and analysis, especially for topics that are not geographically centered.","['or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.

These pipelines are shown\nin Fig. 1, where in each case, we use an LLM to produce a final answer from the information obtained\nfrom each retrieval method. We note that this final processing is done with models with 7-8B parameters.\nWith the GraphRAG pipeline we use Llama-3-8B [22] for question answering, and in all other cases we use\nMistral-7B [10] in tandem with the E5-large-v2 [25] embedding model. In order, left to right:\n1. Extract knowledge using direct graph queries to probe the DKG. This method requires an analyst to\nconvert a natural language question into a suitable graph query. Consistent with other techniques, we\nthen use an LLM to interpret and repackage the retrieved information.\n2. Use G-retriever to automatically fetch a subgraph of the GDELT Knowledge Graph from a natural\nlanguage question. This subgraph retrieval algorithm requires vectorizing the nodes and edges of the\nknowledge graph using a language embedding model. Once retrieved, the subgraph is fed into an LLM\nfor interpretation.\n3. Construct a knowledge graph by parsing full-text documents (scraped from GDELT URLs) with an\nLLM and LlamaIndex’s functionality. We then proceed as in (2).\n4. Create a Vector Store using the text Corpus and ask questions in a typical RAG setting. This in-\nvolves using a language embedding model to vectorize text articles (after splitting them into 500-token\nchunks). Given a question, we use the same embedding model to vectorize it and, using the Euclidean\nmetric to identify nearby vectors, extract the most similar text snippets. The original question and its\nassociated context are then fed into an LLM to process an answer.\n5. Build a knowledge graph as in (3), using the GraphRAG ecosystem. We also use the provided question-\nanswering capabilities of the GraphRAG package.\nWe note that it is typically unnecessary to use an LLM in method (1) and the answer can often be inferred\nafter seeing the raw output of the graph query. In this case, the LLM effectively repackages the result of the\ngraph query in an expected way. As such, we view this first method as a ‘ground-truth’ on the constructed\nKG. Tautologically, if the DKG can be used to answer a question, then a suitable graph query is able to\nextract the correct answer. Conversely, if the KG cannot be used to answer a given question, then a suitable\ngraph query can prove that the answer cannot be found in the KG.\nIt is worth noting why we only employ graph queries on the DKG and not those constructed using LlamaIndex\nor GraphRAG. As noted in our empirical observations of the LLM-produced knowledge graphs, these graphs\nhave far less structure than GDELT itself. This lack of defined structure makes it difficult to form useful\nand interesting graph queries.\n3.3\nResults\nTable 1 shows a sample of questions that were passed through each of the five pipelines from Fig. 1. Exact\nqueries to the GDELT knowledge graph were generated by searching for keywords in the edge triples com-\nprising the knowledge graph. Specifically, we searched for keywords in these triples by converting each triple\nto a sentence (stored as a string) and searching therein. We then used the edge induced subgraph from the\nedge sentences where keywords were found. The following keywords were used for each question:\n• What is the name of the Bridge that collapsed and what river was it on?: Bridge, Collapse, River\n• What is the name of the ship that collided with the baltimore bridge?: Ship, Collide, Baltimore, Bridge\n• How many articles did CNN published about the baltimore bridge collapse?: CNN, Baltimore, Bridge,\nCollapse\n• On what date did the Baltimore Bridge collapse?: Date, Baltimore, Bridge, Collapse\n• Who is Brandon Scott?: Brandon Scott\n• Who is Niki Fennoy?: Niki Fennoy\n• What are the top themes present in the data?: Has Theme\n7'
 'stores reveals that the LLM independently recognizes Brandon Scott as the mayor of Baltimore. For all\nother questions, the language model cannot answer the posed questions by itself due to the recency of the\nbridge collapse.\nTo quantitatively evaluate the quality of the answers generated by our different question-answering methods,\nwe require a set of ground truth answers for the questions posed. Table 2 presents these manually curated\nground truth answers, representing the expected correct responses for each question used in our evalua-\ntion. These ground truth answers serve as the benchmark against which the performance of each system is\nmeasured.\nQuestion\nGround Truth\nWhat is the name of the Bridge that collapsed and\nwhat river was it on?\nThe Francis Scott Key Bridge on the Patapsco River.\nWhat is the name of the ship that collided with the\nbaltimore bridge?\nThe ship was named the Dali.\nHow many articles did CNN publish about the Bal-\ntimore bridge collapse?\nCNN published 5 articles.\nOn what date did the Baltimore Bridge collapse?\nThe collapse occurred on March 26, 2024.\nWho is Brandon Scott?\nBrandon Scott is the Mayor of Baltimore.\nWho is Niki Fennoy?\nNiki Fennoy is a city police spokesman.\nWhat are the top themes present in the data?\nThemes include maritime incidents, manmade disaster, and\nwater-related topics.\nTable 2: Ground Truth Answers for the Baltimore Bridge Collapse Questions\nTo further validate our qualitative findings, Figure 5 presents a quantitative comparison of the semantic\nsimilarity of answers generated by the five different methods when querying the GDELT dataset related\nto the Baltimore bridge collapse. We compute the quality of the result by calculating cosine similarity5, a\nmeasure of the similarity between the embeddings of the predicted answer and the ground truth, with higher\nvalues indicating greater accuracy. The box plots illustrate the distribution of these similarity scores for each\nmethod: Graph Query on DKG, G-Retriever on DKG, RAG using Vector Store, G-Retriever on LKG, and\nGraphRAG Q&A on GRKG. As our qualitative analysis suggested, methods leveraging direct graph queries\non the DKG, standard RAG with a vector store, and GraphRAG Q&A on the GRKG generally exhibit the\nhighest cosine similarity scores, providing quantitative evidence for their superior performance in generating\naccurate and relevant answers compared to the G-Retriever, especially with the LKG. This visualization\nquantitatively confirms the trends observed in the qualitative evaluation presented in Table 1.\n4\nConclusion\nThis work has taken the GDELT GKG database and introduced an ontology to create a knowledge graph\nwith rich structure. We found that while the large KG produced by the GDELT-GKG2 database has rich\ninformation for question-answering, the ad hoc techniques for graph exploration deem further investigation\nfor reliable use. That said, the information stored in the KG produced here is not without flaws, and we\nexpect the example studied here to be useful for the broader synergy between KGs and LLMs as addressed\nby others [18]. While the KGs produced using LlamaIndex captured a summary of the events surrounding\nthe Baltimore bridge collapse, the quality of the resulting structure was not suitable for question-answering.\nThose techniques incorporated into the GraphRAG package did considerably better, but there is room for\nimprovement for answering global questions, resolving duplicate entities, and incorporating ontologically-\nguided relation extraction. We believe the incorporation of the ontology into the relation extraction will\nhave the benefit of allowing tools such as GraphRAG to better answer quantitative questions that only the\nontology based KG pipeline (DKG) was able to answer (e.g., the number of articles published on a topic).\nLarge language models continue to be adapted to solve problems across domains, and the case study on the\nKG built here presents much opportunity for future development. In particular, the debate around using\n5The\nsemantic\nembeddings\nused\nto\ncalculate\nthe\ncosine\nsimilarity\nwere\ngenerated\nusing\nthe\nsentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from the Sentence Transformers library.\n9'

 '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.

This indicates whether the date was a month-day date that did not \nspecify a year (4), a fully-resolved day-level date that included the year (3), a month-\nlevel date that included the year but not a day (2), or a year-level (1) date that did not \ninclude month or day-level information. \no Month.

This is the character offset of the date within the document, indicating \napproximately where it was found in the body.

(comma-delimited blocks, with colon-delimited key/value pairs)  The Global Content \nAnalysis Measures (GCAM) system runs an array of content analysis systems over each \ndocument and compiles their results into this field.  New content analysis systems will be \nconstantly added to the GCAM pipeline over time, meaning the set of available fields will \nconstantly grow over time.  Given that the GCAM system is debuting with over 2,300 dimensions \nand will likely grow to include several thousand more dimensions within the coming months, it \ndiffers in its approach to encoding matches from the GKG’s native thematic coding system.  \nInstead of displaying the full English name of a content analysis dictionary or dimension, it \nassigns each dictionary a unique numeric identifier (DictionaryID) and each dimension within \nthat dictionary is assigned a unique identifier from 1 to the number of dimensions in the \ndictionary (DimensionID).  Each dimension of each dictionary is assessed on a document and \nONLY those dimensions that had one or more matches onto the document are reported.  If a \ndimension did not register any matches on a document, it is not reported in order to save space.  \nThus, the absence of a dimension in this field can be interpreted as a score of 0.  Each \ndimension’s score is written to the V2GCAM field separated by a comma.  For each dimension, a \nnumeric “key” identifies it of the form “DictionaryID.DimensionID”, followed by a colon, \nfollowed by its score.  Most dictionaries are count-based, meaning they report how many words \nin the document were found in that dictionary.  Thus, a score of 18 would mean that 18 words \nfrom the document were found in that dictionary.  Count-based dimensions have a key that \nbegins with “c”.  Some dictionaries, such as SentiWordNet and SentiWords actually assign each \nword a numeric score and the output of the tool is the average of those scores for that \ndocument.  For those dictionaries, an entry will report the number of words in the document \nthat matched into that dictionary, and a separate entry, beginning with a “v” instead of a “c” will \nreport its floating-point average value.  The very first entry in the field has the special reserved \nkey of “wc” and reports the total number of words in the document – this can be used to divide'

Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,'
 'significance, credibly, and/or interest to their audiences.  Only image-based embedded posts are \nincluded in this field – videos are identified in the following field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1SOCIALVIDEOEMBEDS.    (semicolon-delimited list of URLs).  News websites are increasingly \nembedding videos inline in their articles to illustrate them with realtime reaction or citizen \nreporting from the ground.  Some news outlets that also have television properties may cross-\nlink their television reporting into their web-based presentation.  GDELT currently recognizes \nYouTube, DailyMotion, Vimeo, and Vine videos embedded in articles and records their URLs in \nthis field.  Similarly to the field above, this allows for a form of social media “curation” of the \nvideos deemed by the mainstream media to be of greatest relevance, significance, credibly, \nand/or interest to their audiences.   \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1QUOTATIONS.  (pound-delimited (“#”) blocks, with pipe-delimited (“|”) fields).  News \ncoverage frequently features excerpted statements from participants in an event and/or those \naffected by it and these quotations can offer critical insights into differing perspectives and \nemotions surrounding that event.  GDELT identifies and extracts all quoted statements from \neach article and additionally attempts to identify the verb introducing the quote to help lend \nadditional context, separating “John retorted…” from “John agreed…” to show whether the \nspeaker was agreeing with or rejecting the statement being made.  Each quoted statement is \nseparated by a “#” character, and within each block the following fields appear, separated by \npipe (“|”) symbols: \no Offset.  This is the character offset of the quoted statement within the document, \nindicating approximately where it was found in the body.  This can be used to associate \nthe date with the entries from other “V2ENHANCED” fields that appeared in closest \nproximity to it. \no Length.  This is the length of the quoted statement in characters. \no Verb.  This is the verb used to introduce the quote, allowing for separation of \nagreement versus disagreement quotes.  May not be present for all quotes and not all \nverbs are recognized for this field. \no Quote.  The actual quotation itself. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1ALLNAMES.  (semicolon-delimited blocks, with comma-delimited fields)  This field contains \na list of all proper names referenced in the document, along with the character offsets of \napproximately where in the document they were found.  Unlike the V2ENHANCEDPERSONS and \nV2ENHANCEDORGANIZATIONS fields, which are restricted to person and organization names, \nrespectively, this field records ALL proper names referenced in the article, ranging from named \nevents like the Orange Revolution, Umbrella Movement, and Arab Spring, to movements like the \nCivil Rights Movement, to festivals and occurrences like the Cannes Film Festival and World Cup, \nto named wars like World War I, to named dates like Martin Luther King Day and Holocaust \nRemembrance Day, to named legislation like Iran Nuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act \nand Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  This field goes beyond people and organizations to \ncapturing a much broader view of the named events, objects, initiatives, laws, and other types \nof names in each article.  Each name reference is separated by a semicolon, and within each \nreference, the name is specified first, followed by a comma, and then the approximate character \noffset of the reference of that name in the document, allowing it to be associated with other \nentries from other “V2ENHANCED” fields that appear in closest proximity to it.  If a name is \nmentioned multiple times in a document, each mention will appear separately in this field.  This \nfield is designed to be maximally inclusive and in cases of ambiguity, to err on the side of \ninclusion of a name. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1AMOUNTS.  (semicolon-delimited blocks, with comma-delimited fields)  This field contains \na list of all precise numeric amounts referenced in the document, along with the character'
 'THE GDELT EVENT DATABASE \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.0 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their \ndescriptions.  GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, \ncapturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2.  A wide array of variables break \nout the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, \nthe Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique \narray of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both \nactors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the \nstory of each event “in flight” through the global media system. \n \nAt present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, \nhowever in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 \nformat.  The   Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note \nthat files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited).   \n \nWith the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at \nleast through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without \nmodification.  Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning \nFebruary 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches \nback to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. \n  \nThere are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset.  The first is the \ntraditional Event table.  This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several \nchanges as noted below.  In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records \nall mentions of each event.  As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those \nmentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, \nincluding the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus \nbeing buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event \nfrom that specific news report.  The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it \npossible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases.  Those wishing to find the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of \nperiod “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest \nevents with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the \nhighest Confidence measures.  This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each \nindividual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below).  It also makes it possible to \nidentify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those \nwith the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific \nsource language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).']"

This includes all day, month, and year dates, capturing multiple mentions of the same date if they occur multiple times in the text. These extracted dates are encoded in the field **V2.1ENHANCEDDATES**, which contains semicolon-delimited blocks of date references, each with comma-delimited fields specifying:

- **Date Resolution**: Indicates the specificity of the date mention, such as:
  - 4 = month and day but no year,
  - 3 = fully resolved day-level date including year,
  - 2 = month-level date including year but no day,
  - 1 = year-level date only.
- **Month, Day, Year**: Numeric values representing the date components, with zeros used when components are not specified.
- **Offset**: The character offset in the document where the date mention occurs.

The **Offset** plays a crucial role in the concept of **Proximity Context**. Proximity Context is a new capability introduced in GKG version 2.0 that enriches the data by linking various extracted elements based on their closeness within the text. Specifically, the character offset of each date mention allows the system (and users) to associate that date with other entities, themes, or attributes found nearby in the document. This enables more nuanced analysis, such as understanding the context in which a date is mentioned, or identifying relationships between dates and other key information in the article.

In summary:

- The GKG extracts and encodes all date mentions with detailed resolution and location information.
- Proximity Context uses the character offset of these date mentions to relate them to other nearby data points in the text, enhancing the richness and analytic potential of the dataset.","['adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening \nentirely new analytic opportunities.  Some of the most significant changes: \n \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes.  The GDELT Global Content Analysis \nMeasures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment \nanalysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together \nassess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual \ndimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, \nFrench, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and \nUrdu).  GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents \nand reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from \nLIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Translation of 65 Languages.  GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n\uf0b7 \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.  A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now \nspecify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that \nrepresents the core focus of the article.  GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.  This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations \nanywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act \nas a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \n\uf0b7 \nQuotes, Names, and Amounts.  The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food \nprices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable \nitem.  GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to \noffer numeric context to global events.  In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing \nPerson and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, \nsuch as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World \nCup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran \nNuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n\uf0b7 \nDate Mentions.  We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references \nfound in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates \nas possible “anniversary violence” indicators.  All day, month, and year dates are now extracted \nfrom each document. \n\uf0b7 \nProximity Context.  Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the \nintroduction of the new Proximity Context capability.  The GKG records an enormously rich array'
 'EVENT TABLE \n \nEVENTID AND DATE ATTRIBUTES \n \nThe first few fields of an event record capture its globally unique identifier number, the date the event \ntook place on, and several alternatively formatted versions of the date designed to make it easier to \nwork with the event records in different analytical software programs that may have specific date \nformat requirements.  The parenthetical after each variable name gives the datatype of that field. \n \nNote that even though GDELT 2.0 operates at a 15 minute resolution, the date fields in this section still \nrecord the date at the daily level, since this is the resolution that event analysis has historically been \nperformed at.  To examine events at the 15 minute resolution, use the DATEADDED field (the second \nfrom the last field in this table at the end).  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGlobalEventID.  (integer) Globally unique identifier assigned to each event record that uniquely \nidentifies it in the master dataset.  NOTE: While these will often be sequential with date, this is \nNOT always the case and this field should NOT be used to sort events by date: the date fields \nshould be used for this.  NOTE: There is a large gap in the sequence between February 18, 2015 \nand February 19, 2015 with the switchover to GDELT 2.0 – these are not missing events, the ID \nsequence was simply reset at a higher number so that it is possible to easily distinguish events \ncreated after the switchover to GDELT 2.0 from those created using the older GDELT 1.0 system. \n\uf0b7 \nDay.  (integer) Date the event took place in YYYYMMDD format.  See DATEADDED field for \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS date. \n\uf0b7 \nMonthYear.  (integer) Alternative formatting of the event date, in YYYYMM format. \n\uf0b7 \nYear.  (integer) Alternative formatting of the event date, in YYYY format. \n\uf0b7 \nFractionDate.  (floating point) Alternative formatting of the event date, computed as YYYY.FFFF, \nwhere FFFF is the percentage of the year completed by that day.  This collapses the month and \nday into a fractional range from 0 to 0.9999, capturing the 365 days of the year.  The fractional \ncomponent (FFFF) is computed as (MONTH * 30 + DAY) / 365.  This is an approximation and does \nnot correctly take into account the differing numbers of days in each month or leap years, but \noffers a simple single-number sorting mechanism for applications that wish to estimate the \nrough temporal distance between dates. \n \n \nACTOR ATTRIBUTES \n \nThe next fields describe attributes and characteristics of the two actors involved in the event.  This \nincludes the complete raw CAMEO code for each actor, its proper name, and associated attributes.  The \nraw CAMEO code for each actor contains an array of coded attributes indicating geographic, ethnic, and \nreligious affiliation and the actor’s role in the environment (political elite, military officer, rebel, etc).  \nThese 3-character codes may be combined in any order and are concatenated together to form the final \nraw actor CAMEO code.  To make it easier to utilize this information in analysis, this section breaks these \ncodes out into a set of individual fields that can be separately queried.  NOTE: all attributes in this \nsection other than CountryCode are derived from the TABARI ACTORS dictionary and are NOT \nsupplemented from information in the text.  Thus, if the text refers to a group as “Radicalized'
 'terrorists,” but the TABARI ACTORS dictionary labels that group as “Insurgents,” the latter label will be \nused. Use the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph to enrich actors with additional information from the rest \nof the article.  NOTE: the CountryCode field reflects a combination of information from the TABARI \nACTORS dictionary and text, with the ACTORS dictionary taking precedence, and thus if the text refers to \n“French Assistant Minister Smith was in Moscow,” the CountryCode field will list France in the \nCountryCode field, while the geographic fields discussed at the end of this manual may list Moscow as \nhis/her location.  NOTE: One of the two actor fields may be blank in complex or single-actor situations or \nmay contain only minimal detail for actors such as “Unidentified gunmen.” \n \nGDELT currently uses the CAMEO version 1.1b3 taxonomy.  For more information on what each specific \ncode in the fields below stands for and the complete available taxonomy of the various fields below, \nplease see the CAMEO User Manual 1 or the GDELT website for crosswalk files.2 \n \n\uf0b7 \nActor1Code.  (string) The complete raw CAMEO code for Actor1 (includes geographic, class, \nethnic, religious, and type classes).  May be blank if the system was unable to identify an Actor1. \n\uf0b7 \nActor1Name.  (string) The actual name of the Actor1.  In the case of a political leader or \norganization, this will be the leader’s formal name (GEORGE W BUSH, UNITED NATIONS), for a \ngeographic match it will be either the country or capital/major city name (UNITED STATES / \nPARIS), and for ethnic, religious, and type matches it will reflect the root match class (KURD, \nCATHOLIC, POLICE OFFICER, etc).  May be blank if the system was unable to identify an Actor1. \n\uf0b7 \nActor1CountryCode.  (string) The 3-character CAMEO code for the country affiliation of Actor1.  \nMay be blank if the system was unable to identify an Actor1 or determine its country affiliation \n(such as “UNIDENTIFIED GUNMEN”). \n\uf0b7 \nActor1KnownGroupCode. (string) If Actor1 is a known IGO/NGO/rebel organization (United \nNations, World Bank, al-Qaeda, etc) with its own CAMEO code, this field will contain that code. \n\uf0b7 \nActor1EthnicCode.  (string) If the source document specifies the ethnic affiliation of Actor1 and \nthat ethnic group has a CAMEO entry, the CAMEO code is entered here.  NOTE: a few special \ngroups like ARAB may also have entries in the type column due to legacy CAMEO behavior.  \nNOTE: this behavior is highly experimental and may not capture all affiliations properly – for \nmore comprehensive and sophisticated identification of ethnic affiliation, it is recommended \nthat users use the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph’s ethnic, religious, and social group \ntaxonomies and post-enrich actors from the GKG. \n\uf0b7 \nActor1Religion1Code. (string) If the source document specifies the religious affiliation of Actor1 \nand that religious group has a CAMEO entry, the CAMEO code is entered here.  NOTE: a few \nspecial groups like JEW may also have entries in the geographic or type columns due to legacy \nCAMEO behavior.  NOTE: this behavior is highly experimental and may not capture all affiliations \nproperly – for more comprehensive and sophisticated identification of ethnic affiliation, it is \nrecommended that users use the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph’s ethnic, religious, and social \ngroup taxonomies and post-enrich actors from the GKG. \n\uf0b7 \nActor1Religion2Code.  (string) If multiple religious codes are specified for Actor1, this contains \nthe secondary code.  Some religion entries automatically use two codes, such as Catholic, which \ninvokes Christianity as Code1 and Catholicism as Code2. \n\uf0b7 \nActor1Type1Code.  (string) The 3-character CAMEO code of the CAMEO “type” or “role” of \nActor1, if specified.  This can be a specific role such as Police Forces, Government, Military, \nPolitical Opposition, Rebels, etc, a broad role class such as Education, Elites, Media, Refugees, or \n                                                          \n1 http://gdeltproject.org/data/documentation/CAMEO.Manual.1.1b3.pdf  \n2 http://gdeltproject.org/'
 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but'
 'o Word Count.  (integer)  This is the total number of words in the document.  This field \nwas added in version 1.5 of the format. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1ENHANCEDDATES.  (semicolon-delimited blocks, with comma-delimited fields)  This \ncontains a list of all date references in the document, along with the character offsets of \napproximately where in the document they were found.  If a date was mentioned multiple times \nin a document, it will appear multiple times in this field, once for each mention.  Each date \nreference is separated by a semicolon, while the fields within a date are separated by commas.  \nNOTE: this field is identical to GKG 2.0 with the sole exception of the addition of one additional \nDate Resolution type (4 = dates that include a month and day, but not a year). \no Date Resolution.  This indicates whether the date was a month-day date that did not \nspecify a year (4), a fully-resolved day-level date that included the year (3), a month-\nlevel date that included the year but not a day (2), or a year-level (1) date that did not \ninclude month or day-level information. \no Month.  This is the month of the date represented as 1-12.  For year dates this field will \ncontain a 0. \no Day. This is the day of the date represented as 1-31.  For month and year dates this field \nwill contain a 0.  \no Year.  This is the year of the date.  For Resolution=4 dates that include a month and day, \nbut not a year, this field will contain a 0. \no Offset.  This is the character offset of the date within the document, indicating \napproximately where it was found in the body.  This can be used to associate the date \nwith the entries from other “V2ENHANCED” fields that appeared in closest proximity to \nit. \n\uf0b7 \nV2GCAM.  (comma-delimited blocks, with colon-delimited key/value pairs)  The Global Content \nAnalysis Measures (GCAM) system runs an array of content analysis systems over each \ndocument and compiles their results into this field.  New content analysis systems will be \nconstantly added to the GCAM pipeline over time, meaning the set of available fields will \nconstantly grow over time.  Given that the GCAM system is debuting with over 2,300 dimensions \nand will likely grow to include several thousand more dimensions within the coming months, it \ndiffers in its approach to encoding matches from the GKG’s native thematic coding system.  \nInstead of displaying the full English name of a content analysis dictionary or dimension, it \nassigns each dictionary a unique numeric identifier (DictionaryID) and each dimension within \nthat dictionary is assigned a unique identifier from 1 to the number of dimensions in the \ndictionary (DimensionID).  Each dimension of each dictionary is assessed on a document and \nONLY those dimensions that had one or more matches onto the document are reported.  If a \ndimension did not register any matches on a document, it is not reported in order to save space.  \nThus, the absence of a dimension in this field can be interpreted as a score of 0.  Each \ndimension’s score is written to the V2GCAM field separated by a comma.  For each dimension, a \nnumeric “key” identifies it of the form “DictionaryID.DimensionID”, followed by a colon, \nfollowed by its score.  Most dictionaries are count-based, meaning they report how many words \nin the document were found in that dictionary.  Thus, a score of 18 would mean that 18 words \nfrom the document were found in that dictionary.  Count-based dimensions have a key that \nbegins with “c”.  Some dictionaries, such as SentiWordNet and SentiWords actually assign each \nword a numeric score and the output of the tool is the average of those scores for that \ndocument.

"How do the natural language processing algorithms employed in the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph enable comprehensive sentiment analysis across multiple languages, and what new analytic opportunities does the integration of the GCAM module and GDELT Translingual system provide for understanding global emotional undercurrents in real time?","['<1-hop>\n\nINTRODUCTION This codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands GDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards actually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news. It applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to compute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document. To sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening around the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every single day. It has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system on November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an incredible number and diversity of fields. The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent dimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly unimaginable new applications. We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and capabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we are both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original alpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. Due to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create a raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of software packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely complex analytic needs in a single file. Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for direct import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated preprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to extract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package. Thus, users may require more advanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance may be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and network and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook. Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, or other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and size (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in these formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file format needed. The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab- delimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized streamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG. Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, despite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or “.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. The new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards compatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but'

Some of the most significant changes: \uf0b7 Realtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes.

GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents and reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from LIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \uf0b7 Realtime Translation of 65 Languages. GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT Translingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine translation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, representing 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into English for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines. GDELT Translingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the very first glimpses of a world without language barriers. The GKG system now processes every news report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \uf0b7 Relevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds. A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now specify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that represents the core focus of the article. GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats including Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats. In addition, GDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to identify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded social media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is compiled. This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations anywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act as a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \uf0b7 Quotes, Names, and Amounts. The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food prices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable item. GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to offer numeric context to global events. In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing Person and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, such as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World Cup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran Nuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative. Finally, GDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the evolving language used by political leadership across the world. \uf0b7']","The GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1 applies a sophisticated array of natural language processing algorithms to each document, enabling the computation of codified metadata that captures latent and contextual dimensions of global news.

**How NLP Algorithms Enable Multilingual Sentiment Analysis:**

1. **GCAM Module – Multidimensional Emotional Measurement:**  
   - GCAM represents one of the largest deployments of sentiment analysis globally, combining 24 emotional measurement packages.  
   - It assesses over 2,300 emotions and themes in real time from every news article processed.  
   - Crucially, GCAM natively supports 15 languages (including Arabic, Chinese, French, Hindi, Russian, Spanish, and others), allowing direct emotional assessment without relying solely on translation.  
   - The module integrates diverse emotional lexicons and frameworks such as LIWC’s “Anxiety,” Lexicoder’s “Positivity,” WordNet Affect’s “Smugness,” and RID’s “Passivity,” enabling a rich, nuanced capture of emotional undercurrents in text.

2. **GDELT Translingual System – Real-time Translation of 65 Languages:**  
   - GDELT Translingual is a large-scale, real-time machine translation system that translates news content from 65 languages into English.  
   - This covers 98.4% of GDELT’s non-English news monitoring volume, effectively removing language barriers.  
   - By translating all monitored news into English, the system allows the entire GKG and GCAM pipelines to process and analyze global news uniformly.  
   - This enables tracing of people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems, ensuring comprehensive global coverage.

**New Analytic Opportunities from Integrating GCAM and GDELT Translingual:**

- **Planetary-Scale Emotional Underlying Assessment:**  
  The combination allows for unparalleled real-time measurement of emotional reactions and themes worldwide, capturing subtle emotional nuances across diverse cultures and languages.

- **Cross-Language and Cross-Media Tracking:**  
  The integration enables tracing of emotional and thematic content across different languages and media outlets, providing a holistic view of global sentiment dynamics.

- **Real-Time Global Emotional Monitoring:**  
  Analysts can observe emerging emotional trends and reactions as they unfold globally, facilitating timely insights into public mood, social unrest precursors, or political sentiment shifts.

- **Enhanced Contextual Understanding:**  
  By combining rich emotional lexicons with comprehensive translation, the system can disambiguate complex linguistic structures and ambiguous references, improving the accuracy of sentiment and event extraction.

- **New Research and Application Domains:**  
  The system supports advanced applications such as detecting anniversary violence indicators, understanding political leadership language evolution, and integrating multimedia content (images, videos, social embeds) to enrich emotional context.

In summary, the sophisticated NLP algorithms in GDELT’s GKG leverage native multilingual emotional assessment via GCAM and extensive real-time translation via the Translingual system to enable comprehensive, real-time, and cross-lingual sentiment analysis. This integration opens new analytic possibilities for understanding global emotional undercurrents at an unprecedented scale and speed.","['adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening \nentirely new analytic opportunities.

Aksoy, Cliff Joslyn, Benjamin Wilson,\nLee Burke, Tom Grimes\nAbstract\nIn this work we study various Retrieval Augmented Regeneration (RAG) approaches to gain an\nunderstanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in a question-answering analysis. To\ngain this understanding we use a case-study subset of the Global Database of Events, Language, and\nTone (GDELT) dataset as well as a corpus of raw text scraped from the online news articles. To retrieve\ninformation from the text corpus we implement a traditional vector store RAG as well as state-of-the-art\nlarge language model (LLM) based approaches for automatically constructing KGs and retrieving the\nrelevant subgraphs. In addition to these corpus approaches, we develop a novel ontology-based framework\nfor constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from GDELT directly which leverages the underlying schema\nof GDELT to create structured representations of global events. For retrieving relevant information from\nthe ontology-based KGs we implement both direct graph queries and state-of-the-art graph retrieval\napproaches. We compare the performance of each method in a question-answering task. We find that\nwhile our ontology-based KGs are valuable for question-answering, automated extraction of the relevant\nsubgraphs is challenging. Conversely, LLM-generated KGs, while capturing event summaries, often lack\nconsistency and interpretability. Our findings suggest benefits of a synergistic approach between ontology\nand LLM-based KG construction, with proposed avenues toward that end.\n1\nIntroduction\nIn this work we study several approaches for communicating with a corpus of text via relevant text and\nknowledge graph (KG) representation and retrieval facilitated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our\ngoal is to understand the benefits and drawbacks of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches to\ncorpus management and anlysis when combined with an LLM. Throughout we use as a case study a novel\nKG derived from the Global Data on Events, Location, and Tone (GDELT)1 [13] dataset.\nAs a way to enhance LLM outputs, researchers and practitioners have been quick in applying LLMs to\nquery and understand proprietary data through retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) [14]. It has been\nshown that reasoning over the typical RAG framework, which only takes advantage of the unstructured text\narticles, fails to capture global information about the provided data [5, 27].\nMotivated by this limitation, there has been recent interest in adapting these techniques to the case where\nour data has a graph structure, so that the LLM can directly ingest important relationships in the knowledge\nbase [5, 7, 15, 31]. More specifically, KGs [8] are graph structures which are richly attributed with typing\nand semantic information on both nodes and edges. KG techniques provide ways to automatically query\nand extract information stored in a KG without the user explicitly needing to understand query languages\nto probe their knowledge base. Typically, these AI-based search algorithms find subgraphs that can be used\nto answer a user-provided query.\nThe interactions between KGs and LLMs have potential beyond merely question-answering and knowledge\nextraction (see different research directions outlined by Pan et al. [18]). In particular, reflective of KGs\nbeing used to enhance LLM outputs, LLMs can be used to enhance existing KGs or create new ones entirely\nfrom scratch. However, exploration of techniques to this end either (1) do not deal with imposing different\nontological structures in graph creation or (2) only focus on extracting ontological structures using LLMs\n1https://www.gdeltproject.org/\n1']"

While additional cues may be available in the surrounding text, ambiguous event mentions like this are exceptionally common across the world’s media. Similarly, it would be difficult indeed to maintain an exhaustive list of every single political figure in the entire world and thus context is often critical for disambiguating the geographic affiliation of an actor. Even in the case of more senior political leadership, a reference to “Renauld’s press conference this afternoon in Port-au-Prince” most likely refers to Lener Renauld, the Minister of Defense of Haiti, but this disambiguation still carries with it some degree of ambiguity. GDELT makes use of an array of natural language processing algorithms like coreference and deep parsing using whole-of-document context. While these enormously increase GDELT’s ability to understand and extract ambiguous and linguistically complex events, such extractions also come with a higher potential for error. Under GDELT 1.0, the NumMentions field as designed as a composite score of the absolute number of unique documents mentioning an event and the number of revisions to the text required by these various algorithms, up to six revision passes. Under GDELT 2.0, the Mentions table now separates these, with each record in the Mentions table recording an individual mention of an event in an article, while the new Confidence field']","The DATEADDED field in event sourcing stores the date and time an event was added to the master database in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format in UTC timezone, allowing queries at a 15-minute resolution to access events precisely. This temporal granularity complements the Mentions table in GDELT 2.0, which records each individual mention of events from the Event table, enabling detailed event tracking by capturing the trajectory and network structure of stories as they flow through global media. While the DATEADDED field provides exact timing for when events enter the database, the Mentions table tracks mentions irrespective of the original event date, including mentions of historical or anniversary events, thus allowing comprehensive temporal and contextual analysis of event dissemination and media coverage.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer,"The use of the **DATEADDED** field in event sourcing complements the detailed event tracking capabilities provided by the **Mentions** table in GDELT 2.0 by enabling precise temporal resolution and enhancing the management of the network structure of news events in the following ways:

1. **Temporal Resolution at 15-Minute Intervals:**
   - While the main Event table records event dates at the daily level (e.g., the **Day** field in YYYYMMDD format), the **DATEADDED** field stores the exact timestamp when the event was added to the master database in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format (UTC timezone).
   - This finer temporal granularity (15-minute resolution) allows users to query and analyze events with much greater temporal precision than the daily date fields alone.
   - By using **DATEADDED**, analysts can track the emergence and evolution of events in near real-time, which is critical for understanding fast-moving news stories and their development over short time spans.

2. **Linking Event Mentions to Precise Event Timing:**
   - The Mentions table records every individual mention of an event across multiple news reports, each with its own metadata including the **EventTimeDate** (the 15-minute timestamp of the original event’s recording, derived from the event’s **DATEADDED**) and the **MentionTimeDate** (the timestamp of the mention itself).
   - This linkage allows analysts to compare when an event was first recorded versus when it was mentioned in various sources, enabling the study of how news about an event propagates through the media over time.
   - It supports identifying first mentions, repeated mentions, and mentions of historical events, thus managing the temporal dynamics of news coverage.

3. **Managing the Network Structure of News Events:**
   - The Mentions table’s detailed recording of each mention, including source, confidence, and position within the article, creates a rich network of how events are discussed and disseminated across different media outlets and languages.
   - By combining this with the precise timing from **DATEADDED**, it becomes possible to construct temporal networks that show not only which sources mention an event but also when they do so relative to the event’s occurrence.
   - This temporal network structure helps in understanding the flow and trajectory of news stories “in flight” through the global media system, revealing patterns such as early reporting, amplification, and later retrospectives or anniversary mentions.

4. **Filtering and Confidence-Based Analysis:**
   - The Mentions table includes a **Confidence** measure for each mention, indicating the reliability of the event extraction from that particular article.
   - Using **DATEADDED** alongside confidence scores allows users to filter event mentions temporally and qualitatively, focusing on the most reliable and timely reports.
   - This dynamic filtering enhances the ability to manage the temporal resolution of events and the quality of the network structure derived from mentions.

**In summary**, the **DATEADDED** field provides the precise temporal anchor for each event at a 15-minute resolution, which, when integrated with the granular, mention-level data in the Mentions table, enables detailed tracking of the temporal unfolding and network propagation of news events. This synergy allows for sophisticated temporal and network analyses of global news coverage, improving the understanding of how events emerge, spread, and evolve in the media landscape.","['THE GDELT EVENT DATABASE \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.0 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their \ndescriptions.  GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, \ncapturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2.  A wide array of variables break \nout the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, \nthe Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique \narray of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both \nactors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the \nstory of each event “in flight” through the global media system. \n \nAt present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, \nhowever in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 \nformat.  The   Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note \nthat files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited).   \n \nWith the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at \nleast through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without \nmodification.  Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning \nFebruary 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches \nback to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. \n  \nThere are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset.  The first is the \ntraditional Event table.  This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several \nchanges as noted below.  In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records \nall mentions of each event.  As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those \nmentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, \nincluding the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus \nbeing buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event \nfrom that specific news report.  The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it \npossible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases.  Those wishing to find the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of \nperiod “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest \nevents with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the \nhighest Confidence measures.  This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each \nindividual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below).  It also makes it possible to \nidentify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those \nwith the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific \nsource language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).'
 'EVENT TABLE \n \nEVENTID AND DATE ATTRIBUTES \n \nThe first few fields of an event record capture its globally unique identifier number, the date the event \ntook place on, and several alternatively formatted versions of the date designed to make it easier to \nwork with the event records in different analytical software programs that may have specific date \nformat requirements.  The parenthetical after each variable name gives the datatype of that field. \n \nNote that even though GDELT 2.0 operates at a 15 minute resolution, the date fields in this section still \nrecord the date at the daily level, since this is the resolution that event analysis has historically been \nperformed at.  To examine events at the 15 minute resolution, use the DATEADDED field (the second \nfrom the last field in this table at the end).  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGlobalEventID.  (integer) Globally unique identifier assigned to each event record that uniquely \nidentifies it in the master dataset.  NOTE: While these will often be sequential with date, this is \nNOT always the case and this field should NOT be used to sort events by date: the date fields \nshould be used for this.  NOTE: There is a large gap in the sequence between February 18, 2015 \nand February 19, 2015 with the switchover to GDELT 2.0 – these are not missing events, the ID \nsequence was simply reset at a higher number so that it is possible to easily distinguish events \ncreated after the switchover to GDELT 2.0 from those created using the older GDELT 1.0 system. \n\uf0b7 \nDay.  (integer) Date the event took place in YYYYMMDD format.  See DATEADDED field for \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS date. \n\uf0b7 \nMonthYear.  (integer) Alternative formatting of the event date, in YYYYMM format. \n\uf0b7 \nYear.  (integer) Alternative formatting of the event date, in YYYY format. \n\uf0b7 \nFractionDate.  (floating point) Alternative formatting of the event date, computed as YYYY.FFFF, \nwhere FFFF is the percentage of the year completed by that day.  This collapses the month and \nday into a fractional range from 0 to 0.9999, capturing the 365 days of the year.  The fractional \ncomponent (FFFF) is computed as (MONTH * 30 + DAY) / 365.  This is an approximation and does \nnot correctly take into account the differing numbers of days in each month or leap years, but \noffers a simple single-number sorting mechanism for applications that wish to estimate the \nrough temporal distance between dates. \n \n \nACTOR ATTRIBUTES \n \nThe next fields describe attributes and characteristics of the two actors involved in the event.  This \nincludes the complete raw CAMEO code for each actor, its proper name, and associated attributes.  The \nraw CAMEO code for each actor contains an array of coded attributes indicating geographic, ethnic, and \nreligious affiliation and the actor’s role in the environment (political elite, military officer, rebel, etc).  \nThese 3-character codes may be combined in any order and are concatenated together to form the final \nraw actor CAMEO code.  To make it easier to utilize this information in analysis, this section breaks these \ncodes out into a set of individual fields that can be separately queried.  NOTE: all attributes in this \nsection other than CountryCode are derived from the TABARI ACTORS dictionary and are NOT \nsupplemented from information in the text.  Thus, if the text refers to a group as “Radicalized'
 'Finally, a set of fields at the end of the record provide additional data management information for the \nevent record.   \n \n\uf0b7 \nDATEADDED. (integer) This field stores the date the event was added to the master database \nin YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format in the UTC timezone.  For those needing to access events at 15 \nminute resolution, this is the field that should be used in queries. \n\uf0b7 \nSOURCEURL.  (string) This field records the URL or citation of the first news report it found this \nevent in.  In most cases this is the first report it saw the article in, but due to the timing and \nflow of news reports through the processing pipeline, this may not always be the very first \nreport, but is at least in the first few reports. \n \n \n \nMENTIONS TABLE \n \nThe Mentions table is a new addition to GDELT 2.0 and records each mention of the events in the Event \ntable, making it possible to track the trajectory and network structure of a story as it flows through the \nglobal media system.  Each mention of an event receives its own entry in the Mentions table – thus an \nevent which is mentioned in 100 articles will be listed 100 times in the Mentions table.  Mentions are \nrecorded irrespective of the date of the original event, meaning that a mention today of an event from a \nyear ago will still be recorded, making it possible to trace discussion of “anniversary events” or historical \nevents being recontextualized into present actions.  If a news report mentions multiple events, each \nmention is recorded separately in this table.  For translated documents, all measures below are based \non its English translation. \n \nSeveral of the new measures recorded in the Mentions table make it possible to better filter events \nbased on how confident GDELT was in its extraction of that event.  When trying to understand news \nmedia spanning the entire globe, one finds that journalism is rife with ambiguities, assumed background \nknowledge, and complex linguistic structures.  Not every event mention will take the form of “American \nPresident Barack Obama met with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday at a trade summit in Paris, \nFrance.”  Instead, an event mention might more commonly appear as “Obama and Putin were in Paris \nyesterday for a trade summit.  The two leaders met backstage where he discussed his policy on \nUkraine.”  To which of the two leader(s) do “he” and “his” refer?  Is Obama discussing Obama’s policy on \nUkraine, or is Obama discussing Putin’s policy on Ukraine, or is it Putin discussing Putin’s policy or \nperhaps Putin discussing Obama’s policy?  While additional cues may be available in the surrounding \ntext, ambiguous event mentions like this are exceptionally common across the world’s media.  Similarly, \nit would be difficult indeed to maintain an exhaustive list of every single political figure in the entire \nworld and thus context is often critical for disambiguating the geographic affiliation of an actor.  Even in \nthe case of more senior political leadership, a reference to “Renauld’s press conference this afternoon in \nPort-au-Prince” most likely refers to Lener Renauld, the Minister of Defense of Haiti, but this \ndisambiguation still carries with it some degree of ambiguity.

 'records GDELT’s confidence in its extraction of that event from that particular article.  This field is a \npercent, ranging from 10 to 100% and indicates how aggressively GDELT had to perform tasks like \ncoreference or grammatical restructuring to extract the event from that article.  Sorting all mentions of \nan event by this field makes it possible to identify articles featuring the strongest and most \nunambiguous discussion of an event. \n \n\uf0b7 \nGlobalEventID.  (integer)  This is the ID of the event that was mentioned in the article. \n\uf0b7 \nEventTimeDate.  (integer)  This is the 15-minute timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) when the \nevent being mentioned was first recorded by GDELT (the DATEADDED field of the original event \nrecord).  This field can be compared against the next one to identify events being mentioned for \nthe first time (their first mentions) or to identify events of a particular vintage being mentioned \nnow (such as filtering for mentions of events at least one week old). \n\uf0b7 \nMentionTimeDate.  (integer)  This is the 15-minute timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) of the \ncurrent update.  This is identical for all entries in the update file but is included to make it easier \nto load the Mentions table into a database.   \n\uf0b7 \nMentionType.  (integer)  This is a numeric identifier that refers to the source collection the \ndocument came from and is used to interpret the MentionIdentifier in the next column.  In \nessence, it specifies how to interpret the MentionIdentifier to locate the actual document.  At \npresent, it can hold one of the following values: \no 1 = WEB (The document originates from the open web and the MentionIdentifier is a \nfully-qualified URL that can be used to access the document on the web). \no 2 = CITATIONONLY (The document originates from a broadcast, print, or other offline \nsource in which only a textual citation is available for the document.  In this case the \nMentionIdentifier contains the textual citation for the document). \no 3 = CORE (The document originates from the CORE archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through the CORE \nwebsite). \no 4 = DTIC (The document originates from the DTIC archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through the DTIC website). \no 5 = JSTOR (The document originates from the JSTOR archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through your JSTOR \nsubscription if your institution subscribes to it). \no 6 = NONTEXTUALSOURCE (The document originates from a textual proxy (such as closed \ncaptioning) of a non-textual information source (such as a video) available via a URL and \nthe MentionIdentifier provides the URL of the non-textual original source.  At present, \nthis Collection Identifier is used for processing of the closed captioning streams of the \nInternet Archive Television News Archive in which each broadcast is available via a URL, \nbut the URL offers access only to the video of the broadcast and does not provide any \naccess to the textual closed captioning used to generate the metadata.  This code is \nused in order to draw a distinction between URL-based textual material (Collection \nIdentifier 1 (WEB) and URL-based non-textual material like the Television News Archive). \n\uf0b7 \nMentionSourceName.  (integer)  This is a human-friendly identifier of the source of the \ndocument.  For material originating from the open web with a URL this field will contain the top-\nlevel domain the page was from.  For BBC Monitoring material it will contain “BBC Monitoring” \nand for JSTOR material it will contain “JSTOR.”  This field is intended for human display of major \nsources as well as for network analysis of information flows by source, obviating the \nrequirement to perform domain or other parsing of the MentionIdentifier field.'

We again note that the document and mention identifiers are the\nsame field, but have different field names (e.g., a URL is typically used for the document identifier and the\nsame URL is used for the mention identifier).\n3\nCase Study - Baltimore Bridge Collapse\nHere we will provide an analysis of data collected over a recent and short period of time to do question-\nanswering based analysis. The point of collecting recent data is that the LLMs used have not yet been\ntrained on these events (at the time of this study) and thus the knowledge systems are needed to supply\nthe LLM with relevant information. Specifically, this analysis uses a subset of the GDELT data collected\non March 26th of 2024 from 12:00 AM to 10:00 AM during and after the collapse of the Francis Scott Key\nBridge in Baltimore, Maryland, which occurred at approximately 1:29 AM. This 10 hour window of time\ncaptures the media response to this disaster. We filtered down the collected mentions data to only include\nrows in any of the related data if it included any of the keywords “Baltimore”, “bridge”, “collapse”, or\n“ship”. We then used all GLOBALEVENTIDs and MentionIdentifiers in this reduced mentions file to collect\nthe relevant events and articles. This filtration resulted in using approximately 1.33% of the available data\nwith 371 events, 2047 mentions, and 209 articles.\n3.1\nGDELT Knowledge Graphs\nUsing the GDELT data directly and the scraped text we can construct a total of three KGs:\nDirect KG (DKG): The first KG was simply a direct conversion of the subset of the original GDELT data\ninto an equivalent KG as specified by our ontology in Fig. 3. This KG is shown in Fig. 4a.\nLlamaIndex KG (LKG): The second KG was generated by an LLM deployed against a text corpus con-\nsisting of the source articles collected by scraping URLs of the 209 articles included in our GDELT\nsubset, and enriched with knowledge of the ontology. This KG is shown in Fig. 4b.\nGraphRAG KG (GRKG): The final KG was generated using the same articles as the LKG, using Mi-\ncrosoft’s open-source GraphRAG package with default configuration parameters. This KG is shown in\nFig. 4c.\nThe example KG constructed using our ontology (DKG) is shown in a reduced form in Fig. 4a. The nodes\nare color coded based on their source. Note that node and edge labels are not shown in order to facilitate\nclarity. This KG is one component and has 3,469 nodes and 18,052 edges.\nTo construct a KG directly from the corpus of source document text (LKG) shown in Fig. 4b, we used\nMixtral-8x7B [11] as our base model, following the procedure outlined by the LlamaIndex package developers\n[1]. The LLM is prompted to extract triples from the news articles according to a prompt provided in the\nparameter kg triplet prompt. Using the default prompt, the ontology does not get incorporated and the\nresulting KG is a star-shaped graph with a single central node and all other nodes connected to this center,\nthere being no other edges. When we change the prompt to consider the entire ontology, we again get a\nstar-shaped graph. Nontrivial graph structure arose when we prompted the language model with a reduced\nversion of the ontology with adaptation for unstructured text. In particular, our prompt asked for:\n• Vertices of one of the following types: “Event”, “Article”, “Mention”, “Person”, “Quotation”, “Orga-\nnization”, “Location”, and “Other”, with the last type serving as a catch-all.\n5']"
"What limitations did the previous GKG system have in associating contextual details, and how do the unique record identifiers introduced in GKG 2.1 improve the management and referencing of GKG records?","['<1-hop>\n\nof contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and events driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context. However, with the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together. For example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all appeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in that article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, but there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional roles. GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference to an object in the original article. While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new field allows for simple proximity-based contextualization. In the case of the example article above, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry than to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to the others. In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other connectivity can be explored. Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity indicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and geographic affiliations. \uf0b7 Over 100 New GKG Themes. There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating oil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social issues like marginalization and burning in effigy. The list of recognized infectious diseases, ethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 global humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global currencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking species migration and poaching. \uf0b7 Extensible XML Block. GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for its source material. Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage across the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures. As GDELT encodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and government reports, additional types of information are available to codify. As a first example of this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion words of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and the Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East. Academic literature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the papers cited within that paper. This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation graphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts. Yet, such citation lists are unique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it would be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these kinds of specialized data types. Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called V2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are applicable only to subsets of the collection. Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode highly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \uf0b7'
 '<2-hop>\n\nUnique Record Identifiers. To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event Database, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier. As with the event database, sequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a record across the entire collection. The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will make it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. 1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html']","The previous GKG system had difficulty associating various data points together, such as linking people, organizations, locations, and their functional roles within the same article. For example, while it could record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin appeared in an article along with the United States and Russia and roles like President and Secretary of State, it could not associate each person with the corresponding location and role. GKG 2.1 addresses this limitation by providing approximate character offsets for each reference, enabling proximity-based contextualization to better recover functional, thematic, and geographic affiliations. Additionally, GKG 2.1 introduces unique record identifiers for every GKG record, aligning with the GDELT Event Database practices. These unique identifiers allow each record to be distinctly referenced across the entire collection, improving the management and precise referencing of GKG records.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer,"The previous GKG system had significant limitations in associating contextual details because it could record entities such as people, organizations, locations, and roles mentioned in an article but could not link these data points together within the context of the article. For example, while it could note that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all appeared in the same article along with mentions of the United States, Russia, and roles like President and Secretary of State, it could not associate each person with their corresponding location or functional role. This lack of association made it difficult to understand the relationships and contextual connections between entities within the text.

GKG 2.1 improves this situation by introducing the approximate character offset of each reference to an object in the original article. Although this does not provide deep semantic association, it enables simple proximity-based contextualization. For instance, mentions of the United States are likely to occur closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry than to Vladimir Putin, and the role ""Secretary of State"" is likely closer to John Kerry than to the others. This proximity information allows users to explore critical information on roles, geographic, thematic associations, and other connectivity more effectively. Pilot tests have shown that these proximity indicators are highly effective at recovering functional, thematic, and geographic affiliations.

Additionally, GKG 2.1 introduces unique record identifiers (GKGRECORDID) for every GKG record. These identifiers are globally unique and take the form of a date-oriented serial number (e.g., ""YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X"" or ""YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX""), where the first part encodes the date and time of the update batch and the second part is a sequential number within that batch. This system allows each record to be uniquely identified across the entire GKG database. The unique record identifiers improve the management and referencing of GKG records by making it easier to uniquely refer to a particular record, facilitating better tracking, filtering (e.g., by language through the ""T"" indicator for translated documents), and integration with other datasets or systems.","['of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.

Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html'
 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.'
 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but'

For all\nother questions, the language model cannot answer the posed questions by itself due to the recency of the\nbridge collapse.\nTo quantitatively evaluate the quality of the answers generated by our different question-answering methods,\nwe require a set of ground truth answers for the questions posed. Table 2 presents these manually curated\nground truth answers, representing the expected correct responses for each question used in our evalua-\ntion. These ground truth answers serve as the benchmark against which the performance of each system is\nmeasured.\nQuestion\nGround Truth\nWhat is the name of the Bridge that collapsed and\nwhat river was it on?\nThe Francis Scott Key Bridge on the Patapsco River.\nWhat is the name of the ship that collided with the\nbaltimore bridge?\nThe ship was named the Dali.\nHow many articles did CNN publish about the Bal-\ntimore bridge collapse?\nCNN published 5 articles.\nOn what date did the Baltimore Bridge collapse?\nThe collapse occurred on March 26, 2024.\nWho is Brandon Scott?\nBrandon Scott is the Mayor of Baltimore.\nWho is Niki Fennoy?\nNiki Fennoy is a city police spokesman.\nWhat are the top themes present in the data?\nThemes include maritime incidents, manmade disaster, and\nwater-related topics.\nTable 2: Ground Truth Answers for the Baltimore Bridge Collapse Questions\nTo further validate our qualitative findings, Figure 5 presents a quantitative comparison of the semantic\nsimilarity of answers generated by the five different methods when querying the GDELT dataset related\nto the Baltimore bridge collapse. We compute the quality of the result by calculating cosine similarity5, a\nmeasure of the similarity between the embeddings of the predicted answer and the ground truth, with higher\nvalues indicating greater accuracy. The box plots illustrate the distribution of these similarity scores for each\nmethod: Graph Query on DKG, G-Retriever on DKG, RAG using Vector Store, G-Retriever on LKG, and\nGraphRAG Q&A on GRKG. As our qualitative analysis suggested, methods leveraging direct graph queries\non the DKG, standard RAG with a vector store, and GraphRAG Q&A on the GRKG generally exhibit the\nhighest cosine similarity scores, providing quantitative evidence for their superior performance in generating\naccurate and relevant answers compared to the G-Retriever, especially with the LKG. This visualization\nquantitatively confirms the trends observed in the qualitative evaluation presented in Table 1.\n4\nConclusion\nThis work has taken the GDELT GKG database and introduced an ontology to create a knowledge graph\nwith rich structure. We found that while the large KG produced by the GDELT-GKG2 database has rich\ninformation for question-answering, the ad hoc techniques for graph exploration deem further investigation\nfor reliable use. That said, the information stored in the KG produced here is not without flaws, and we\nexpect the example studied here to be useful for the broader synergy between KGs and LLMs as addressed\nby others [18]. While the KGs produced using LlamaIndex captured a summary of the events surrounding\nthe Baltimore bridge collapse, the quality of the resulting structure was not suitable for question-answering.\nThose techniques incorporated into the GraphRAG package did considerably better, but there is room for\nimprovement for answering global questions, resolving duplicate entities, and incorporating ontologically-\nguided relation extraction. We believe the incorporation of the ontology into the relation extraction will\nhave the benefit of allowing tools such as GraphRAG to better answer quantitative questions that only the\nontology based KG pipeline (DKG) was able to answer (e.g., the number of articles published on a topic).\nLarge language models continue to be adapted to solve problems across domains, and the case study on the\nKG built here presents much opportunity for future development. In particular, the debate around using\n5The\nsemantic\nembeddings\nused\nto\ncalculate\nthe\ncosine\nsimilarity\nwere\ngenerated\nusing\nthe\nsentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from the Sentence Transformers library.\n9'

1. **Sentiment Analysis (GCAM Module):**  
   - GDELT's Global Content Analysis Measures (GCAM) module performs real-time sentiment analysis on news articles, assessing over 2,300 emotions and themes.  
   - It integrates 24 emotional measurement packages that capture a wide range of emotional dimensions (e.g., anxiety, positivity, smugness, passivity) across multiple languages.  
   - This extensive emotional profiling allows GDELT to detect emotional undercurrents and reactions in news content globally, which can signal tensions or sentiments related to violence or conflict.

2. **Date Mentions Extraction:**  
   - GDELT extracts all day, month, and year date references mentioned within news articles and documents.  
   - This extraction enables the system to identify repeated mentions of specific dates, which can be indicative of anniversaries.  
   - By tracking these date mentions, GDELT can detect when certain dates are repeatedly referenced in the context of violence or conflict, suggesting potential ""anniversary violence"" indicators.

3. **Combining Sentiment and Date Mentions:**  
   - By linking the emotional tone (from sentiment analysis) with the presence of specific date mentions, GDELT can identify patterns where emotionally charged content coincides with references to particular dates.  
   - Such patterns may indicate that anniversaries of past violent events are being highlighted or commemorated, which can be a precursor or indicator of anniversary-related violence.

The point of collecting recent data is that the LLMs used have not yet been\ntrained on these events (at the time of this study) and thus the knowledge systems are needed to supply\nthe LLM with relevant information. Specifically, this analysis uses a subset of the GDELT data collected\non March 26th of 2024 from 12:00 AM to 10:00 AM during and after the collapse of the Francis Scott Key\nBridge in Baltimore, Maryland, which occurred at approximately 1:29 AM. This 10 hour window of time\ncaptures the media response to this disaster. We filtered down the collected mentions data to only include\nrows in any of the related data if it included any of the keywords “Baltimore”, “bridge”, “collapse”, or\n“ship”. We then used all GLOBALEVENTIDs and MentionIdentifiers in this reduced mentions file to collect\nthe relevant events and articles. This filtration resulted in using approximately 1.33% of the available data\nwith 371 events, 2047 mentions, and 209 articles.\n3.1\nGDELT Knowledge Graphs\nUsing the GDELT data directly and the scraped text we can construct a total of three KGs:\nDirect KG (DKG): The first KG was simply a direct conversion of the subset of the original GDELT data\ninto an equivalent KG as specified by our ontology in Fig. 3. This KG is shown in Fig. 4a.\nLlamaIndex KG (LKG): The second KG was generated by an LLM deployed against a text corpus con-\nsisting of the source articles collected by scraping URLs of the 209 articles included in our GDELT\nsubset, and enriched with knowledge of the ontology. This KG is shown in Fig. 4b.\nGraphRAG KG (GRKG): The final KG was generated using the same articles as the LKG, using Mi-\ncrosoft’s open-source GraphRAG package with default configuration parameters. This KG is shown in\nFig. 4c.\nThe example KG constructed using our ontology (DKG) is shown in a reduced form in Fig. 4a. The nodes\nare color coded based on their source. Note that node and edge labels are not shown in order to facilitate\nclarity. This KG is one component and has 3,469 nodes and 18,052 edges.\nTo construct a KG directly from the corpus of source document text (LKG) shown in Fig. 4b, we used\nMixtral-8x7B [11] as our base model, following the procedure outlined by the LlamaIndex package developers\n[1]. The LLM is prompted to extract triples from the news articles according to a prompt provided in the\nparameter kg triplet prompt. Using the default prompt, the ontology does not get incorporated and the\nresulting KG is a star-shaped graph with a single central node and all other nodes connected to this center,\nthere being no other edges. When we change the prompt to consider the entire ontology, we again get a\nstar-shaped graph. Nontrivial graph structure arose when we prompted the language model with a reduced\nversion of the ontology with adaptation for unstructured text. In particular, our prompt asked for:\n• Vertices of one of the following types: “Event”, “Article”, “Mention”, “Person”, “Quotation”, “Orga-\nnization”, “Location”, and “Other”, with the last type serving as a catch-all.\n5'
 'EVENT TABLE \n \nEVENTID AND DATE ATTRIBUTES \n \nThe first few fields of an event record capture its globally unique identifier number, the date the event \ntook place on, and several alternatively formatted versions of the date designed to make it easier to \nwork with the event records in different analytical software programs that may have specific date \nformat requirements.  The parenthetical after each variable name gives the datatype of that field. \n \nNote that even though GDELT 2.0 operates at a 15 minute resolution, the date fields in this section still \nrecord the date at the daily level, since this is the resolution that event analysis has historically been \nperformed at.  To examine events at the 15 minute resolution, use the DATEADDED field (the second \nfrom the last field in this table at the end).  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGlobalEventID.  (integer) Globally unique identifier assigned to each event record that uniquely \nidentifies it in the master dataset.  NOTE: While these will often be sequential with date, this is \nNOT always the case and this field should NOT be used to sort events by date: the date fields \nshould be used for this.  NOTE: There is a large gap in the sequence between February 18, 2015 \nand February 19, 2015 with the switchover to GDELT 2.0 – these are not missing events, the ID \nsequence was simply reset at a higher number so that it is possible to easily distinguish events \ncreated after the switchover to GDELT 2.0 from those created using the older GDELT 1.0 system. \n\uf0b7 \nDay.  (integer) Date the event took place in YYYYMMDD format.  See DATEADDED field for \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS date. \n\uf0b7 \nMonthYear.  (integer) Alternative formatting of the event date, in YYYYMM format. \n\uf0b7 \nYear.  (integer) Alternative formatting of the event date, in YYYY format. \n\uf0b7 \nFractionDate.  (floating point) Alternative formatting of the event date, computed as YYYY.FFFF, \nwhere FFFF is the percentage of the year completed by that day.  This collapses the month and \nday into a fractional range from 0 to 0.9999, capturing the 365 days of the year.  The fractional \ncomponent (FFFF) is computed as (MONTH * 30 + DAY) / 365.  This is an approximation and does \nnot correctly take into account the differing numbers of days in each month or leap years, but \noffers a simple single-number sorting mechanism for applications that wish to estimate the \nrough temporal distance between dates. \n \n \nACTOR ATTRIBUTES \n \nThe next fields describe attributes and characteristics of the two actors involved in the event.  This \nincludes the complete raw CAMEO code for each actor, its proper name, and associated attributes.  The \nraw CAMEO code for each actor contains an array of coded attributes indicating geographic, ethnic, and \nreligious affiliation and the actor’s role in the environment (political elite, military officer, rebel, etc).  \nThese 3-character codes may be combined in any order and are concatenated together to form the final \nraw actor CAMEO code.  To make it easier to utilize this information in analysis, this section breaks these \ncodes out into a set of individual fields that can be separately queried.  NOTE: all attributes in this \nsection other than CountryCode are derived from the TABARI ACTORS dictionary and are NOT \nsupplemented from information in the text.

These ground truth answers serve as the benchmark against which the performance of each system is\nmeasured.\nQuestion\nGround Truth\nWhat is the name of the Bridge that collapsed and\nwhat river was it on?\nThe Francis Scott Key Bridge on the Patapsco River.\nWhat is the name of the ship that collided with the\nbaltimore bridge?\nThe ship was named the Dali.\nHow many articles did CNN publish about the Bal-\ntimore bridge collapse?\nCNN published 5 articles.\nOn what date did the Baltimore Bridge collapse?\nThe collapse occurred on March 26, 2024.\nWho is Brandon Scott?\nBrandon Scott is the Mayor of Baltimore.\nWho is Niki Fennoy?\nNiki Fennoy is a city police spokesman.\nWhat are the top themes present in the data?\nThemes include maritime incidents, manmade disaster, and\nwater-related topics.\nTable 2: Ground Truth Answers for the Baltimore Bridge Collapse Questions\nTo further validate our qualitative findings, Figure 5 presents a quantitative comparison of the semantic\nsimilarity of answers generated by the five different methods when querying the GDELT dataset related\nto the Baltimore bridge collapse. We compute the quality of the result by calculating cosine similarity5, a\nmeasure of the similarity between the embeddings of the predicted answer and the ground truth, with higher\nvalues indicating greater accuracy. The box plots illustrate the distribution of these similarity scores for each\nmethod: Graph Query on DKG, G-Retriever on DKG, RAG using Vector Store, G-Retriever on LKG, and\nGraphRAG Q&A on GRKG.

That said, the information stored in the KG produced here is not without flaws, and we\nexpect the example studied here to be useful for the broader synergy between KGs and LLMs as addressed\nby others [18]. While the KGs produced using LlamaIndex captured a summary of the events surrounding\nthe Baltimore bridge collapse, the quality of the resulting structure was not suitable for question-answering.\nThose techniques incorporated into the GraphRAG package did considerably better, but there is room for\nimprovement for answering global questions, resolving duplicate entities, and incorporating ontologically-\nguided relation extraction. We believe the incorporation of the ontology into the relation extraction will\nhave the benefit of allowing tools such as GraphRAG to better answer quantitative questions that only the\nontology based KG pipeline (DKG) was able to answer (e.g., the number of articles published on a topic).\nLarge language models continue to be adapted to solve problems across domains, and the case study on the\nKG built here presents much opportunity for future development.

"How does the GDELT Event Database structure its event records using the expanded dyadic CAMEO format, and in what way does the introduction of unique record identifiers in the GKG align with the practices of the GDELT Event Database to facilitate advanced data referencing and analysis?","['<1-hop>\n\nINTRODUCTION This codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their descriptions. GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, capturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2. A wide array of variables break out the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, the Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique array of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both actors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the story of each event “in flight” through the global media system. At present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, however in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 format. The Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note that files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited). With the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at least through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without modification. Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning February 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches back to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. There are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset. The first is the traditional Event table. This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several changes as noted below. In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records all mentions of each event. As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those mentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, including the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus being buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event from that specific news report. The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it possible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases. Those wishing to find the earliest glimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of period “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest events with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the highest Confidence measures. This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each individual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below). It also makes it possible to identify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those with the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific source language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).'
 '<2-hop>\n\nUnique Record Identifiers. To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event Database, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier. As with the event database, sequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a record across the entire collection. The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will make it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. 1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html']","The GDELT Event Database structures its event records using an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, which captures two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2.

In alignment with these practices, the GKG (Global Knowledge Graph) now assigns a unique record identifier to every GKG record, similar to the GDELT Event Database. These unique identifiers do not imply sequential events but uniquely identify records across the entire collection, thereby facilitating easier and more precise referencing of particular records. This alignment enhances the ability to perform advanced data analysis and question-answering by ensuring consistent and unique identification of events and knowledge graph records.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer,"The GDELT Event Database structures its event records using an **expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format**. This format captures two actors—Actor1 and Actor2—and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2. The event records break out the raw CAMEO actor codes into detailed fields for easier interaction with the data. Similarly, the action codes are decomposed into their hierarchical components. Additionally, the database includes a Goldstein ranking score for each event and a comprehensive set of georeferencing fields that provide estimated geographic positioning at the landmark-centroid level for both actors and the event location. This detailed structuring allows for rich, multi-dimensional analysis of events.

Moreover, the GDELT Event Database includes a ""Mentions"" table that records every mention of each event across multiple news reports. Each mention is accompanied by metadata such as the location of the mention within the article (e.g., lead paragraph or buried in the text) and a ""confidence"" score indicating the reliability of the event identification from that specific news report. This confidence measure enables dynamic filtering of the event stream to suit different analytical needs, such as focusing on the earliest reports or the most detailed and reliable accounts.

Regarding the **Global Knowledge Graph (GKG)**, the introduction of **unique record identifiers** aligns with the GDELT Event Database’s practice of assigning unique identifiers to each event record. In the GKG, every record is now assigned a unique identifier that uniquely identifies it across the entire collection, similar to how the GDELT Event Database uses unique event IDs (GLOBALEVENTID) and mention identifiers. These unique identifiers do not imply sequential order but serve as stable references to individual records.

This alignment facilitates advanced data referencing and analysis by enabling precise linking and cross-referencing between GKG records and GDELT Event records. For example, analysts can uniquely refer to a particular GKG record or event, integrate data across datasets, and track the provenance and context of information at a granular level. The use of unique identifiers in both datasets supports complex network analyses, provenance tracking, and the integration of thematic, geographic, and event data into unified analytical frameworks.

**In summary:**

- **GDELT Event Database structure:**
  - Uses an expanded dyadic CAMEO format capturing Actor1, Actor2, and the action.
  - Breaks out actor codes and action codes into detailed hierarchical fields.
  - Includes Goldstein scores and detailed georeferencing for actors and event locations.
  - Maintains a Mentions table recording all news mentions of each event with metadata including confidence scores.

- **GKG unique record identifiers:**
  - Each GKG record is assigned a unique identifier, mirroring the unique event and mention IDs in the Event Database.
  - These identifiers enable precise referencing and linking of records.
  - This practice aligns the GKG with the Event Database, facilitating integrated, advanced data analysis and referencing across both datasets.","['THE GDELT EVENT DATABASE \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.0 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their \ndescriptions.

 'of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html'
 '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,'
 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but'
 '• Solid edges indicate a field in a relational table and are labeled with the type of semantic relation.\n• Dashed and bold edges indicate the structural, one-to-many relations in the relational schema.\nThe naming convention also captures the unique identifier for these csv files, so that ⟨GLOBALEVENTID⟩\nidentifies unique Events, the pair (⟨GLOBALEVENTID⟩, ⟨MentionIdentifier⟩) identifies unique Mentions, as\ndoes ⟨DocumentIdentifier⟩for Articles. We again note that the document and mention identifiers are the\nsame field, but have different field names (e.g., a URL is typically used for the document identifier and the\nsame URL is used for the mention identifier).\n3\nCase Study - Baltimore Bridge Collapse\nHere we will provide an analysis of data collected over a recent and short period of time to do question-\nanswering based analysis. The point of collecting recent data is that the LLMs used have not yet been\ntrained on these events (at the time of this study) and thus the knowledge systems are needed to supply\nthe LLM with relevant information. Specifically, this analysis uses a subset of the GDELT data collected\non March 26th of 2024 from 12:00 AM to 10:00 AM during and after the collapse of the Francis Scott Key\nBridge in Baltimore, Maryland, which occurred at approximately 1:29 AM. This 10 hour window of time\ncaptures the media response to this disaster. We filtered down the collected mentions data to only include\nrows in any of the related data if it included any of the keywords “Baltimore”, “bridge”, “collapse”, or\n“ship”. We then used all GLOBALEVENTIDs and MentionIdentifiers in this reduced mentions file to collect\nthe relevant events and articles. This filtration resulted in using approximately 1.33% of the available data\nwith 371 events, 2047 mentions, and 209 articles.\n3.1\nGDELT Knowledge Graphs\nUsing the GDELT data directly and the scraped text we can construct a total of three KGs:\nDirect KG (DKG): The first KG was simply a direct conversion of the subset of the original GDELT data\ninto an equivalent KG as specified by our ontology in Fig. 3. This KG is shown in Fig. 4a.\nLlamaIndex KG (LKG): The second KG was generated by an LLM deployed against a text corpus con-\nsisting of the source articles collected by scraping URLs of the 209 articles included in our GDELT\nsubset, and enriched with knowledge of the ontology. This KG is shown in Fig. 4b.\nGraphRAG KG (GRKG): The final KG was generated using the same articles as the LKG, using Mi-\ncrosoft’s open-source GraphRAG package with default configuration parameters. This KG is shown in\nFig. 4c.\nThe example KG constructed using our ontology (DKG) is shown in a reduced form in Fig. 4a. The nodes\nare color coded based on their source. Note that node and edge labels are not shown in order to facilitate\nclarity. This KG is one component and has 3,469 nodes and 18,052 edges.\nTo construct a KG directly from the corpus of source document text (LKG) shown in Fig. 4b, we used\nMixtral-8x7B [11] as our base model, following the procedure outlined by the LlamaIndex package developers\n[1]. The LLM is prompted to extract triples from the news articles according to a prompt provided in the\nparameter kg triplet prompt. Using the default prompt, the ontology does not get incorporated and the\nresulting KG is a star-shaped graph with a single central node and all other nodes connected to this center,\nthere being no other edges. When we change the prompt to consider the entire ontology, we again get a\nstar-shaped graph. Nontrivial graph structure arose when we prompted the language model with a reduced\nversion of the ontology with adaptation for unstructured text. In particular, our prompt asked for:\n• Vertices of one of the following types: “Event”, “Article”, “Mention”, “Person”, “Quotation”, “Orga-\nnization”, “Location”, and “Other”, with the last type serving as a catch-all.\n5']"

Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only and one containing the full GKG file.

As with the event database, sequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a record across the entire collection. The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will make it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. 1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html']","The introduction of unique record identifiers in the GKG aligns with the practices of the GDELT Event Database by assigning every GKG record a unique identifier, which uniquely identifies a record across the entire collection, similar to the event database. This change facilitates easier and more precise referencing of particular GKG records. Additionally, the GKG data environment is simplified by eliminating the separate counts-only file, consolidating data into a single full GKG file that includes thematic and other data fields to contextualize counts and tie them into the GDELT Event Database. Together, these changes improve data management and usability within the GDELT Event Database framework.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer,"The introduction of unique record identifiers in the GKG (Global Knowledge Graph) aligns with the practices of the GDELT Event Database by adopting a similar approach to uniquely identify each record across the entire collection. Specifically:

- **Alignment with GDELT Event Database Practices:**  
  Like the Event Database, each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier (GKGRECORDID). However, while the Event Database uses semi-sequential numeric IDs, the GKG uses a date-oriented serial number format. This format includes the full date and time of the update batch (in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format) followed by a dash and a sequential number for records created in that batch (e.g., ""20150203033000-5""). For translated documents, a ""T"" is inserted after the dash (e.g., ""20150203033000-T5""). This system ensures that each record can be uniquely and unambiguously referenced, similar to the Event Database’s approach.

- **Impact on Simplifying the GKG Data Environment:**  
  The addition of unique record identifiers simplifies the GKG data environment in several ways:
  1. **Unique Reference:** It becomes easier to uniquely refer to and track individual GKG records, facilitating data management, querying, and integration with other datasets such as the Event Database.
  2. **Elimination of Clustering:** Previously, GKG 1.0 clustered multiple articles with identical metadata into single rows with a count field (NumArticles). With unique IDs, GKG 2.1 treats each document as a separate record, removing the need for clustering and simplifying data structure and processing.
  3. **Single Data File:** The GKG has eliminated the separate counts-only file, consolidating all data into a single comprehensive file. This reduces complexity for users who previously had to manage multiple files and ensures all thematic and contextual data are available in one place.
  4. **Stable and Consistent Format:** The unique identifiers contribute to a stable, production-ready file format (GKG 2.1) that aligns structurally with the Event Database, making it easier for users to develop tools and workflows that work across both datasets.

In summary, by introducing unique record identifiers modeled after the Event Database’s system, the GKG enhances data traceability and consistency, while simplifying the overall data environment through the removal of clustering and consolidation of data files. This alignment facilitates easier integration, referencing, and analysis of GKG records in conjunction with event data.","['of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html'
 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.'
 '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,'

 'adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening \nentirely new analytic opportunities.  Some of the most significant changes: \n \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes.  The GDELT Global Content Analysis \nMeasures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment \nanalysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together \nassess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual \ndimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, \nFrench, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and \nUrdu).  GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents \nand reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from \nLIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Translation of 65 Languages.  GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n\uf0b7 \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.  A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now \nspecify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that \nrepresents the core focus of the article.  GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.  This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations \nanywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act \nas a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \n\uf0b7 \nQuotes, Names, and Amounts.  The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food \nprices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable \nitem.  GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to \noffer numeric context to global events.  In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing \nPerson and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, \nsuch as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World \nCup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran \nNuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n\uf0b7 \nDate Mentions.  We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references \nfound in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates \nas possible “anniversary violence” indicators.  All day, month, and year dates are now extracted \nfrom each document. \n\uf0b7 \nProximity Context.

 '<2-hop>\n\nINTRODUCTION This codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands GDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards actually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news. It applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to compute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document. To sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening around the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every single day. It has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system on November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an incredible number and diversity of fields. The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent dimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly unimaginable new applications. We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and capabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we are both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original alpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. Due to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create a raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of software packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely complex analytic needs in a single file. Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for direct import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated preprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to extract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package. Thus, users may require more advanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance may be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and network and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook. Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, or other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and size (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in these formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file format needed. The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab- delimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized streamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG. Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, despite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or “.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. The new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards compatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but']","The introduction of the Proximity Context capability in GKG Version 2.1 represents the greatest change from version 1.0, enhancing the overall format by providing a richer array of contextual information. While version 1.0 focused on encoding date mentions such as all day, month, and year dates extracted from documents to identify repeating mentions like ""anniversary violence"" indicators, Version 2.1 expands the system's ability to capture latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of global news through sophisticated natural language processing algorithms. Importantly, Version 2.1 preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format to ensure backwards compatibility, and the system continues to generate daily Version 1.0 files in parallel, allowing users to transition smoothly while benefiting from the new features like Proximity Context.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer,"The introduction of the **Proximity Context** capability in GKG Version 2.1 significantly improves upon the features available in Version 1.0 in several key ways, particularly regarding the encoding of date mentions and maintaining backwards compatibility:

1. **Enhanced Contextual Representation**:  
   - Proximity Context allows the GKG to record a much richer array of contextual information about how entities (people, organizations, locations, themes, events) are mentioned in relation to each other within the text. This means that arguments, discussions, or mentions that previously might not have been captured in detail are now included, providing a deeper understanding of the latent dimensions and network structure of the news content.

2. **Encoding of Date Mentions**:  
   - Version 2.1 explicitly extracts and encodes all date references found in news articles, including day, month, and year mentions. This was a new feature requested by users to identify repeating mentions of specific dates, such as “anniversary violence” indicators. This capability was not present in Version 1.0, which focused more on physical occurrences and geographic mentions.

3. **Inclusion Criteria Expanded Beyond Geographic Mentions**:  
   - Unlike Version 1.0, which required at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location for an article to be included, Version 2.1 includes articles even if they have no geographic mentions but contain other extracted information such as GCAM emotional scores or political leader mentions. This broadens the scope of the GKG to cover topics like cybersecurity or constitutional discourse that may lack geographic references but are still highly relevant.

4. **Backwards Compatibility and Format Stability**:  
   - The new Proximity Context and other enhancements are integrated while preserving most of the previous fields in their existing format to maintain backwards compatibility.  
   - The GKG 2.1 format files continue to be generated alongside the original Version 1.0 files, allowing users to continue using their existing workflows with minimal disruption.  
   - Code designed for Version 1.0 can be adapted to Version 2.1 with minimal modification, ensuring a smooth transition.  
   - The format has moved from alpha to production status, indicating stability and commitment to maintaining the format going forward.

5. **Structural and Processing Improvements**:  
   - The introduction of Proximity Context necessitated changes in how documents are clustered and represented. Unlike Version 1.0, which clustered multiple articles with identical metadata into a single row, Version 2.1 lists each document separately to preserve unique metadata such as GCAM emotional scores and translation provenance.  
   - This change supports more granular and accurate analysis, especially when considering the proximity of mentions and the context in which dates and other entities appear.

**Summary:**  
The Proximity Context capability in GKG Version 2.1 enhances the system by enabling detailed encoding of date mentions and richer contextual relationships between entities, expanding inclusion criteria beyond geographic mentions, and maintaining backwards compatibility with Version 1.0. This results in a more comprehensive, nuanced, and stable dataset that supports a wider range of analytic applications while allowing existing users to transition smoothly.","['THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.

 'adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening \nentirely new analytic opportunities.  Some of the most significant changes: \n \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes.  The GDELT Global Content Analysis \nMeasures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment \nanalysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together \nassess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual \ndimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, \nFrench, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and \nUrdu).  GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents \nand reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from \nLIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Translation of 65 Languages.  GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n\uf0b7 \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.  A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now \nspecify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that \nrepresents the core focus of the article.  GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.  This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations \nanywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act \nas a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \n\uf0b7 \nQuotes, Names, and Amounts.  The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food \nprices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable \nitem.  GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to \noffer numeric context to global events.  In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing \nPerson and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, \nsuch as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World \nCup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran \nNuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n\uf0b7 \nDate Mentions.  We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references \nfound in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates \nas possible “anniversary violence” indicators.  All day, month, and year dates are now extracted \nfrom each document. \n\uf0b7 \nProximity Context.  Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the \nintroduction of the new Proximity Context capability.  The GKG records an enormously rich array'
 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.'
 '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,'
 'THE GDELT EVENT DATABASE \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.0 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their \ndescriptions.  GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, \ncapturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2.  A wide array of variables break \nout the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, \nthe Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique \narray of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both \nactors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the \nstory of each event “in flight” through the global media system. \n \nAt present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, \nhowever in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 \nformat.  The   Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note \nthat files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited).   \n \nWith the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at \nleast through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without \nmodification.  Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning \nFebruary 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches \nback to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. \n  \nThere are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset.  The first is the \ntraditional Event table.  This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several \nchanges as noted below.  In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records \nall mentions of each event.  As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those \nmentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, \nincluding the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus \nbeing buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event \nfrom that specific news report.  The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it \npossible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases.  Those wishing to find the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of \nperiod “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest \nevents with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the \nhighest Confidence measures.  This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each \nindividual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below).  It also makes it possible to \nidentify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those \nwith the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific \nsource language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).']"

Thus, GKG 2.1 no longer clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of extracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the GKG stream. The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering. In addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article to appear in the GKG. Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output. However, many topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy discussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a single location. This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of high relevance to many GDELT user communities. Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in the GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional scores. An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,']","The GCAM module, which provides realtime measurement of more than 2,300 emotions and themes across multiple languages, along with realtime translation of 65 languages, significantly impacted the GKG system's handling of articles in the GKG 2.1 format. Unlike the GKG 1.0 format, which clustered articles together based on shared metadata such as locations, themes, people, and organizations, the introduction of GCAM revealed that articles with identical metadata could have very different emotional and thematic scores. Therefore, GKG 2.1 no longer clusters documents with the same metadata but treats each article as a separate entry to preserve the distinct GCAM emotional assessments. Additionally, the realtime translation capability enabled identification of metadata provenance at the document level, further supporting this change. Moreover, the inclusion criteria for articles in GKG 2.1 were relaxed compared to GKG 1.0 and 2.0; previously, articles needed at least one geocoded geographic location to be included, but with GCAM's emotional scoring, articles without geographic mentions but containing emotional data are now included, broadening the scope of content captured by the GKG system.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer,"The introduction of GCAM with its realtime measurement of 2,300 emotions and themes and realtime translation of 65 languages significantly changed how the GKG 2.1 format handles article clustering and inclusion criteria compared to GKG 1.0 and 2.0 in the following ways:

1. **Article Clustering:**

   - **GKG 1.0:** Articles were clustered together if they shared the same GKG metadata (locations, themes, people, organizations). Multiple articles with identical metadata were grouped into a single row, with a field (NumArticles) indicating the number of articles clustered.
   
   - **GKG 2.1:** Due to GCAM’s detailed assessment of over 2,300 emotions and themes, articles that might share the same locations, themes, people, and organizations could have very different emotional and thematic scores. This made the previous clustering approach inadequate because it would lose the granularity of emotional/thematic differences.
   
   - Therefore, **GKG 2.1 no longer clusters articles based on shared metadata.** Instead, each article is represented as a separate entry in the GKG stream, even if multiple articles share the same metadata. This allows the system to preserve the unique GCAM emotional and thematic scores for each article.
   
   - The NumArticles field was discontinued in GKG 2.1 because clustering was removed.

2. **Inclusion Criteria:**

   - **GKG 1.0 and 2.0:** An article had to have at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location to be included in the GKG output. This excluded many articles on topics without strong geographic references (e.g., cybersecurity, constitutional discourse).
   
   - **GKG 2.1:** With the addition of GCAM emotional/thematic scores and realtime translation, the inclusion criteria were broadened. An article is now included if it contains **any successfully extracted information**, including GCAM emotional scores, even if it has no geographic mentions.
   
   - This change allows inclusion of a much wider range of articles, including those without geographic data but with relevant emotional or thematic content, thus expanding the scope and relevance of the GKG dataset.

3. **Realtime Translation and Provenance:**

   - GKG 2.1 incorporates realtime translation of 65 languages, enabling processing of global news in multiple languages.
   
   - To maintain provenance and accuracy, GKG 2.1 includes fields that identify whether a document was machine translated and from which language, allowing users to filter or analyze translated versus original content.
   
   - This multilingual capability supports the expanded emotional and thematic analysis by GCAM across languages, which was not present in earlier versions.

**Summary:**

- The realtime measurement of 2,300 emotions and themes by GCAM necessitated abandoning the clustering of articles with identical metadata (used in GKG 1.0), because articles with the same metadata could have very different emotional profiles.
- GKG 2.1 treats each article as a unique entry to preserve these detailed emotional and thematic distinctions.
- The inclusion criteria were relaxed from requiring geographic mentions to accepting any article with extracted metadata, including GCAM scores, broadening the dataset’s coverage.
- Realtime translation of 65 languages enables global multilingual processing and tracking of metadata provenance at the document level.

These changes collectively make GKG 2.1 a richer, more granular, and more globally inclusive dataset compared to GKG 1.0 and 2.0.","['\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,'
 'adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening \nentirely new analytic opportunities.  Some of the most significant changes: \n \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes.  The GDELT Global Content Analysis \nMeasures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment \nanalysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together \nassess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual \ndimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, \nFrench, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and \nUrdu).  GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents \nand reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from \nLIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Translation of 65 Languages.  GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n\uf0b7 \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.  A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now \nspecify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that \nrepresents the core focus of the article.  GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.  This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations \nanywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act \nas a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \n\uf0b7 \nQuotes, Names, and Amounts.  The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food \nprices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable \nitem.  GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to \noffer numeric context to global events.  In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing \nPerson and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, \nsuch as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World \nCup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran \nNuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n\uf0b7 \nDate Mentions.  We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references \nfound in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates \nas possible “anniversary violence” indicators.  All day, month, and year dates are now extracted \nfrom each document. \n\uf0b7 \nProximity Context.  Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the \nintroduction of the new Proximity Context capability.  The GKG records an enormously rich array'
 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.'
 'the MentionIdentifier field above to merge the Mentions table with the GKG table to access the \ncomplete set of 2,300 emotions and themes from the GCAM system.    \n\uf0b7 \nMentionDocTranslationInfo.  (string)  This field is internally delimited by semicolons and is used \nto record provenance information for machine translated documents indicating the original \nsource language and the citation of the translation system used to translate the document for \nprocessing.  It will be blank for documents originally in English.  At this time the field will also be \nblank for documents translated by a human translator and provided to GDELT in English (such as \nBBC Monitoring materials) – in future this field may be expanded to include information on \nhuman translation pipelines, but at present it only captures information on machine translated \nmaterials.  An example of the contents of this field might be “srclc:fra; eng:Moses 2.1.1 / \nMosesCore Europarl fr-en / GT-FRA 1.0”.  NOTE:  Machine translation is often not as accurate as \nhuman translation and users requiring the highest possible confidence levels may wish to \nexclude events whose only mentions are in translated reports, while those needing the highest-\npossible coverage of the non-Western world will find that these events often offer the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or smaller-bore events of less interest to Western media.   \no SRCLC. This is the Source Language Code, representing the three-letter ISO639-2 code of \nthe language of the original source material.   \no ENG.  This is a textual citation string that indicates the engine(s) and model(s) used to \ntranslate the text.  The format of this field will vary across engines and over time and no \nexpectations should be made on the ordering or formatting of this field.  In the example \nabove, the string “Moses 2.1.1 / MosesCore Europarl fr-en / GT-FRA 1.0” indicates that \nthe document was translated using version 2.1.1 of the Moses 7 SMT platform, using the \n“MosesCore Europarl fr-en” translation and language models, with the final translation \nenhanced via GDELT Translingual’s own version 1.0 French translation and language \nmodels.  A value of “GT-ARA 1.0” indicates that GDELT Translingual’s version 1.0 Arabic \ntranslation and language models were the sole resources used for translation.  \nAdditional language systems used in the translation pipeline such as word segmentation \nsystems are also captured in this field such that a value of “GT-ZHO 1.0 / Stanford PKU” \nindicates that the Stanford Chinese Word Segmenter 8 was used to segment the text \ninto individual words and sentences, which were then translated by GDELT \nTranslingual’s own version 1.0 Chinese (Traditional or Simplified) translation and \nlanguage models. \n\uf0b7 \nExtras.  (string)  This field is currently blank, but is reserved for future use to encode special \nadditional measurements for selected material. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n7 http://www.statmt.org/moses/ \n \n8 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/segmenter.shtml'
 'the score of any word-count field to convert to a percentage density score.  As an example, \nassume a document with 125 words.  The General Inquirer dictionary has been assigned the \nDictionaryID of 2 and its “Bodypt” dimension has a DimensionID of 21.  SentiWordNet has a \nDictionaryID of 10 and its “Positive” dimension has a DimensionID of 1.  Thus, the V2GCAM field \nfor a document might look like “wc:125,c2.21:4,c10.1:40,v10.1:3.21111111” indicating that the \ndocument had 125 words, that 4 of those words were found the General Inquirer “Bodypt” \nlexicon, that 40 of those words were found in the SentiWordNet lexicon, and that the average \nnumeric score of all of the words found in the SentiWordNet lexicon was 3.21111111.  For a \ncomplete list of the available dimensions, along with their assigned DictionaryID and \nDimensionID codes, their assigned key, and their human name and full citation to cite that \ndimension, please see the GCAM Master Codebook. 8  NOTE: the scores for all dimensions, both \nEnglish and non-English dimensions, will be listed together in this field – please see the \ncodebooks to determine the source language of a specific dimension.  NOTE: if non-English \ndictionaries are available for a given language and generated at least one match for that \ndocument, an additional “nwc” entry will be added which reflects the word count in the native \nlanguage, since languages may have differing word counts in their native and translated forms.  \nThis count will be absent if no native dictionaries yielded a match for the document. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1SHARINGIMAGE.  (textual URL)  Many news websites specify a so-called “sharing image” for \neach article in which the news outlet manually specifies a particular image to be displayed when \nthat article is shared via social media or other formats.  Not all news outlets specify a sharing \nimage and some sites simply use their logo, but for those that do use this field, it represents the \noutlet’s selection of the single image that best captures the overall focus and contents of the \nstory.  GDELT currently recognizes a variety of formats for specifying this image, including Open \nGraph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats, among others.  \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1RELATEDIMAGES.  (semicolon-delimited list of URLs).  News articles frequently include \nphotographs, figures, and other imagery to illustrate the story, ranging from a single illustrative \nphotograph at top, to lengthy photo essays interspersed through the entirety of an article.  Such \nimagery lends a rich visual tapestry to a news report, helping to clarify, for example, whether an \narticle about a “protest blocking a highway” involves hundreds of activists along its length, or \njust a handful of people in one location, or whether a gas explosion leveled a building or merely \nshattered its windows.  GDELT uses a suite of highly sophisticated algorithms to actually “read” \nthrough each article in the way a human would, evaluating each image on to determine its \nrelevance, based on positioning, captioning, referencing, and context, and compiles a list of the \nURLs of the images it deems to be most relevant to the article.  Thus, unrelated inset boxes, \nadvertisements, and other imagery are ignored and this field contains only a list of images most \nillustrative of the core of the story.  This feature is in alpha release and involves a number of \nhighly complex algorithms working together in concert and thus may make mistakes.  We will be \nimproving this algorithm over time and would appreciate any feedback you may have on the \nkinds of images it incorrectly includes and those that it misses. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1SOCIALIMAGEEMBEDS.  (semicolon-delimited list of URLs).  News websites are increasingly \nembedding image-based social media posts inline in their articles to illustrate them with \nrealtime reaction or citizen reporting from the ground.  GDELT currently recognizes embedded \nimage-based Twitter and Instagram posts and records their URLs in this field.  Only those posts \ncontaining imagery are included in this field.  This acts as a form of social media “curation” in \nwhich news outlets are wading through the deluge of social media reaction or reporting about a \nspecific situation and hand-selecting key image posts deemed of greatest relevance, \n                                                          \n8 http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/GCAM-MASTERCODEBOOK.xlsx']"
