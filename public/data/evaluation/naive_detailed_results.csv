How does the ontology-based framework developed for constructing knowledge graphs from the GDELT dataset improve question-answering capabilities compared to traditional text-based Retrieval Augmented Generation approaches?,"['arXiv:2503.07584v3  [cs.IR]  24 Jun 2025\nTalking to GDELT Through Knowledge Graphs\nAudun Myers, Max Vargas, Sinan G. Aksoy, Cliff Joslyn, Benjamin Wilson,\nLee Burke, Tom Grimes\nAbstract\nIn this work we study various Retrieval Augmented Regeneration (RAG) approaches to gain an\nunderstanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in a question-answering analysis. To\ngain this understanding we use a case-study subset of the Global Database of Events, Language, and\nTone (GDELT) dataset as well as a corpus of raw text scraped from the online news articles. To retrieve\ninformation from the text corpus we implement a traditional vector store RAG as well as state-of-the-art\nlarge language model (LLM) based approaches for automatically constructing KGs and retrieving the\nrelevant subgraphs. In addition to these corpus approaches, we develop a novel ontology-based framework\nfor constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from GDELT directly which leverages the underlying schema\nof GDELT to create structured representations of global events. For retrieving relevant information from\nthe ontology-based KGs we implement both direct graph queries and state-of-the-art graph retrieval\napproaches. We compare the performance of each method in a question-answering task. We find that\nwhile our ontology-based KGs are valuable for question-answering, automated extraction of the relevant\nsubgraphs is challenging. Conversely, LLM-generated KGs, while capturing event summaries, often lack\nconsistency and interpretability. Our findings suggest benefits of a synergistic approach between ontology\nand LLM-based KG construction, with proposed avenues toward that end.\n1\nIntroduction\nIn this work we study several approaches for communicating with a corpus of text via relevant text and\nknowledge graph (KG) representation and retrieval facilitated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our\ngoal is to understand the benefits and drawbacks of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches to\ncorpus management and anlysis when combined with an LLM. Throughout we use as a case study a novel\nKG derived from the Global Data on Events, Location, and Tone (GDELT)1 [13] dataset.\nAs a way to enhance LLM outputs, researchers and practitioners have been quick in applying LLMs to\nquery and understand proprietary data through retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) [14]. It has been\nshown that reasoning over the typical RAG framework, which only takes advantage of the unstructured text\narticles, fails to capture global information about the provided data [5, 27].\nMotivated by this limitation, there has been recent interest in adapting these techniques to the case where\nour data has a graph structure, so that the LLM can directly ingest important relationships in the knowledge\nbase [5, 7, 15, 31]. More specifically, KGs [8] are graph structures which are richly attributed with typing\nand semantic information on both nodes and edges. KG techniques provide ways to automatically query\nand extract information stored in a KG without the user explicitly needing to understand query languages\nto probe their knowledge base. Typically, these AI-based search algorithms find subgraphs that can be used\nto answer a user-provided query.\nThe interactions between KGs and LLMs have potential beyond merely question-answering and knowledge\nextraction (see different research directions outlined by Pan et al. [18]). In particular, reflective of KGs\nbeing used to enhance LLM outputs, LLMs can be used to enhance existing KGs or create new ones entirely\nfrom scratch. However, exploration of techniques to this end either (1) do not deal with imposing different\nontological structures in graph creation or (2) only focus on extracting ontological structures using LLMs\n1https://www.gdeltproject.org/\n1'

Higher cosine similarity indicates a greater\nsemantic similarity between the predicted and actual answers.\nraw documents or a curated KG should not be of ‘Either/Or’, but rather integration between these two\nmodalities. Our findings demonstrate the significant value of combining the strengths of both approaches.\nWe believe that by combining news articles in the form of a vector store with the rich ontological structure of\nthe GDELT knowledge graph through an LLM interface, the resulting information extraction system would\nallow for better knowledge retrieval than either component alone. Specifically, the direct knowledge graph\n(DKG) excels at answering high-level or aggregate questions, providing a strong foundation of structured\nknowledge. While the vector store is well-suited for identifying local information within the documents that\nmight be missing or less readily accessible in the DKG, GraphRAG has shown effectiveness on both local and\nglobal information. Therefore, we hypothesize that the optimal approach is the integrated system, leveraging\nthe DKG for broad context and the vector store and GraphRAG for detailed, document-specific insights,\nand for enhanced global information retrieval. Further work must be done to determine the extent to which\nthe textual article data can be used to refine the KG produced here; some of our examples showed that\ninformation stored in the DKG does not truthfully reflect the information in the articles. Conversely, we\nmust determine how the constructed KG can be used to better search the associated vector store. Some of\nthese research directions include the following:\n• Use LLMs to add new information to an existing KG by creating new entities or edge relations. Based\noff our observations with LlamaIndex and GraphRAG, we need careful monitoring to ensure that the\nLLM formats its responses to properly adhere to the ontological structures and other existing structures\nin the KG. To this end, it can be beneficial to adapt the triples in the DKG produced here to fine-tune\nthe language model or guide its output with in-context learning.\n• By introducing RAG capabilities, we can fact check the KG against the raw textual information. For\nexample, we found that Niki Fennoy was only mentioned in 3 articles but misattributed to 11 others.\nThe use of LLMs give a potential avenue to fact-check existing relations.\n5\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is under information release number PNNL-SA-209193.\n10'
 '[23, 28].\nThroughout this work we use the GDELT dataset as a case study.\nGDELT is a massive collection of\nnews reports that provide a real-time computational record of global events that is published every 15\nminutes. It aggregates information from various news sources, blogs, and social media platforms to construct\na large collection of data including information on people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions.\nEssentially, GDELT offers a snapshot of the world’s collective events, enabling researchers and analysts to\nexplore complex patterns and relationships within global society. By analyzing this data, it’s possible to\nidentify emerging trends, assess risks, understand public sentiment, and track the evolution of various issues\nover time. The applications of GDELT are diverse and far-reaching. Some of the most common use cases\nincluding event monitoring [16, 17, 29], risk assessment and prediction [6, 19, 20, 24, 26, 30], and social\nscience research [2, 3, 4, 12].\nGDELT describes its structure as a Global Knowledge Graph (GKG, specifically, we use the the Global\nKnowledge Graph edition 2 (GKG2) of GDELT). But in fact GDELT-GKG2 is implemented as multiple\nlinked tables recording information about the relationship between articles and events, and thus effectively\nhas the structure of a relational database. Another important contribution of this paper is to actually realize\nGKG2 properly in the mathematical form of a KG, effectively a graph database, derived from and consistent\nwith its native relational database form. To facilitate this effort, we have identified a lightweight ontology\nfor GDELT in the form of its graph schema, realizing its relational database schema in a KG form.\nUsing the KG that we construct from the GDELT-GKG2 dataset, we provide a case study to explore the\nutility of LLM-based tools to extract information and confirm that the KG can be used for question-answering\nin cases where traditional RAG fails. As part of our analysis, we compare to KGs produced from processing\nvarious news articles with an LLM, prompting it to try and adhere to a reduced version of the same ontology.\nThe current state of neurosymbolic work is noted for the plethora of experimental architectures available.\nWhile details are explicated below in Section 3.2, we preview ours in Figure 1, including the five method-\nological pathways which are quantitatively compared: 1) graph queries on the KG (called the DKG) derived\n“directly” from GKG2; 2) use of G-Retriever2 [7] against the same DKG; 3) RAG against a vector store\nrepresentation of GKG2; 4) G-Retriever against a second KG (called the LKG) derived from using Llamain-\ndex3 [1] against the GDELT source articles; and 5) GraphRAG4 Q&A deployed against a third KG (called\nGRKG) using Microsoft’s open-source GraphRAG package with default configuration parameters.\nFigure 1: Pipeline of different experiments ran to analyze the GDELT database using an LLM.\n2https://github.com/XiaoxinHe/G-Retriever\n3https://www.llamaindex.ai/\n4https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/\n2'

For all\nother questions, the language model cannot answer the posed questions by itself due to the recency of the\nbridge collapse.\nTo quantitatively evaluate the quality of the answers generated by our different question-answering methods,\nwe require a set of ground truth answers for the questions posed.

We compute the quality of the result by calculating cosine similarity5, a\nmeasure of the similarity between the embeddings of the predicted answer and the ground truth, with higher\nvalues indicating greater accuracy. The box plots illustrate the distribution of these similarity scores for each\nmethod: Graph Query on DKG, G-Retriever on DKG, RAG using Vector Store, G-Retriever on LKG, and\nGraphRAG Q&A on GRKG. As our qualitative analysis suggested, methods leveraging direct graph queries\non the DKG, standard RAG with a vector store, and GraphRAG Q&A on the GRKG generally exhibit the\nhighest cosine similarity scores, providing quantitative evidence for their superior performance in generating\naccurate and relevant answers compared to the G-Retriever, especially with the LKG. This visualization\nquantitatively confirms the trends observed in the qualitative evaluation presented in Table 1.\n4\nConclusion\nThis work has taken the GDELT GKG database and introduced an ontology to create a knowledge graph\nwith rich structure. We found that while the large KG produced by the GDELT-GKG2 database has rich\ninformation for question-answering, the ad hoc techniques for graph exploration deem further investigation\nfor reliable use. That said, the information stored in the KG produced here is not without flaws, and we\nexpect the example studied here to be useful for the broader synergy between KGs and LLMs as addressed\nby others [18]. While the KGs produced using LlamaIndex captured a summary of the events surrounding\nthe Baltimore bridge collapse, the quality of the resulting structure was not suitable for question-answering.\nThose techniques incorporated into the GraphRAG package did considerably better, but there is room for\nimprovement for answering global questions, resolving duplicate entities, and incorporating ontologically-\nguided relation extraction. We believe the incorporation of the ontology into the relation extraction will\nhave the benefit of allowing tools such as GraphRAG to better answer quantitative questions that only the\nontology based KG pipeline (DKG) was able to answer (e.g., the number of articles published on a topic).\nLarge language models continue to be adapted to solve problems across domains, and the case study on the\nKG built here presents much opportunity for future development. In particular, the debate around using\n5The\nsemantic\nembeddings\nused\nto\ncalculate\nthe\ncosine\nsimilarity\nwere\ngenerated\nusing\nthe\nsentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from the Sentence Transformers library.\n9'

This is\npotentially due to the summarizing nature of LlamaIndex and GraphRAG to only capture the key edges and\nnodes. Further, we find that the LLM used to create the LKG had considerable trouble with adhering to\nthe prescribed ontology, creating many new edge types outside those originally prescribed. For example, the\nLLM creates a triple (Maersk, Chartered, Container ship) when using LlamaIndex. While factually\ncorrect, the Chartered edge type is not specified in the LLM prompt. Even though the LLM struggles\nto adhere to our proposed structures, many of the edges that are mined from the article text are easily\ninterpretable.\nTo validate the quality of our ontology and to show some of its use cases in an automatic way we provide\na qualitative comparison where we use an LLM for question-answering on the GDELT dataset.

However, exploration of techniques to this end either (1) do not deal with imposing different ontological structures in graph creation or (2) only focus on extracting ontological structures using LLMs 1https://www.gdeltproject.org/ 1']","The ontology-based framework developed for constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from the GDELT dataset improves question-answering capabilities compared to traditional text-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches in several key ways:

1. **Structured Representation Leveraging GDELT Schema**:  
   The ontology-based framework uses the underlying schema of GDELT to create a richly structured KG that accurately reflects the relationships and types of entities and events in the data. This contrasts with traditional RAG approaches that rely on unstructured text retrieval, which may miss or inadequately represent global or aggregate information.

2. **Enhanced Ability to Answer High-Level and Quantitative Questions**:  
   The ontology-based KG (referred to as the Direct Knowledge Graph or DKG) excels at answering high-level or aggregate questions, such as counting the number of articles published on a topic. These types of questions are challenging for traditional text-based RAG methods, which are better suited for retrieving local or document-specific information.

3. **Improved Consistency and Interpretability**:  
   While LLM-generated KGs (constructed from raw text using methods like LlamaIndex or GraphRAG) capture event summaries, they often suffer from inconsistency, entity resolution issues (e.g., duplicate nodes for the same entity), and lack adherence to a prescribed ontology. The ontology-based KG enforces a consistent schema, improving interpretability and reliability of the extracted knowledge.

4. **Direct Graph Querying and Advanced Graph Retrieval**:  
   The ontology-based KG allows for direct graph queries and the use of graph retrieval methods that can exploit the structured relationships encoded in the KG. This enables more precise and semantically rich retrieval of relevant subgraphs for question answering, which traditional vector store RAG approaches cannot provide.

5. **Synergistic Potential with LLMs**:  
   Although automated extraction of relevant subgraphs from the ontology-based KG can be challenging, the framework supports a synergistic approach where LLMs can be used to augment or refine the KG, and the KG can guide LLM-based retrieval. This integration promises better overall performance than either approach alone.

6. **Quantitative Evidence of Superior Performance**:  
   Empirical evaluation on a case study (Baltimore bridge collapse) showed that methods leveraging the ontology-based KG (DKG) and direct graph queries achieved higher semantic similarity scores in question-answering tasks compared to traditional RAG on vector stores or LLM-generated KGs.

In summary, the ontology-based framework improves question-answering by providing a structured, consistent, and semantically rich knowledge graph derived directly from GDELT’s schema, enabling better handling of complex, aggregate, and global queries that traditional text-based RAG approaches struggle with.","The ontology-based framework for constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from GDELT leverages the underlying schema of GDELT to create structured representations of global events.

What is the main advatage of GDELT GKG Versoin 2.1 for knowlege graph analysis?,"['2\nConstructing a Knowledge Graph for GDELT\nAs previously mentioned, while the GDELT-GKG2 dataset is not actually natively in the form of a knowledge\ngraph, it is advertised and frequently cited as being one. We believe that we are making a distinct contribution\nto the research community by converting the very popular GKG2 database into a proper KG.\nGKG2 is natively a database of three related tables:\n• expert.csv captures event information;\n• GKG.csv captures article information; and\n• mentions.csv relates which articles mention which events.\nFigure 2: GDELT GKG 2.0 schema relating articles (GKG), mentions, and events (Export).\nThe database schema for these three CSV files is shown in Fig. 2 (see also [9]). The key characteristics of\nthis database relational schema should be interpreted as follows:\n• The three tables are color-coded by Events (green), Mentions (pink), and Articles (blue).\n• The single table of Events is shown in multiple green sub-tables, simply for clarity and convenience to\nlayout a long record structure.\n• Single-headed arrows represent one-to-many relationships between the tables. Specifically:\n– Each Event maps to multiple Mentions via the shared GLOBALEVENTID field.\n– Each Article maps to multiple Mentions via the DocumentIdentifer field on the Article side\nmatching to the MentionIdentifier field on the Mention side.\n• In this way, the Mentions table acts as a “pairs file” recording a many-many relation between Events\nand Articles: each event can be mentioned in multiple articles, and dually each article can men-\ntion many events. Each Article also has both a unique identifier through the GKGRECORDID or the\nDocumentIdentifer fields, since each row in the GKG data represents a single article.\n3'
 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but'
 'of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html'

It applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to compute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document. To sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening around the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every single day. It has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system on November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an incredible number and diversity of fields. The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent dimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly unimaginable new applications. We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and capabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we are both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original alpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. Due to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create a raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of software packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely complex analytic needs in a single file. Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for direct import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated preprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to extract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package. Thus, users may require more advanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance may be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and network and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook. Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, or other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and size (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in these formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file format needed. The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab- delimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized streamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG. Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, despite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or “.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. The new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards compatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but']","The main advantage of GDELT GKG Version 2.1 for knowledge graph analysis is its introduction of **Proximity Context**, which provides the approximate character offset of each reference to an object within the original article. This allows for simple proximity-based contextualization, enabling the association of people, organizations, locations, roles, and thematic elements more effectively than before. For example, it helps to determine which persons are mentioned closer to certain locations or roles within the text, facilitating the exploration of functional, thematic, and geographic affiliations. This enhancement significantly improves the ability to analyze and connect various data points within the knowledge graph, overcoming previous limitations where such associations were difficult to establish.

Additional advantages include:
- Over 100 new themes expanding the scope of topics covered.
- Real-time measurement of 2,300 emotions and themes across multiple languages.
- Unique record identifiers for easier referencing.
- An extensible XML block for encoding specialized data types.
- Real-time translation of 65 languages enabling global coverage.

However, the key distinctive feature for knowledge graph analysis is the **Proximity Context capability**, which greatly enhances the semantic and contextual richness of the graph data.","GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1 expands the ability to quantify global human society by representing latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of global news.

 'the score of any word-count field to convert to a percentage density score.  As an example, \nassume a document with 125 words.  The General Inquirer dictionary has been assigned the \nDictionaryID of 2 and its “Bodypt” dimension has a DimensionID of 21.  SentiWordNet has a \nDictionaryID of 10 and its “Positive” dimension has a DimensionID of 1.  Thus, the V2GCAM field \nfor a document might look like “wc:125,c2.21:4,c10.1:40,v10.1:3.21111111” indicating that the \ndocument had 125 words, that 4 of those words were found the General Inquirer “Bodypt” \nlexicon, that 40 of those words were found in the SentiWordNet lexicon, and that the average \nnumeric score of all of the words found in the SentiWordNet lexicon was 3.21111111.  For a \ncomplete list of the available dimensions, along with their assigned DictionaryID and \nDimensionID codes, their assigned key, and their human name and full citation to cite that \ndimension, please see the GCAM Master Codebook. 8  NOTE: the scores for all dimensions, both \nEnglish and non-English dimensions, will be listed together in this field – please see the \ncodebooks to determine the source language of a specific dimension.  NOTE: if non-English \ndictionaries are available for a given language and generated at least one match for that \ndocument, an additional “nwc” entry will be added which reflects the word count in the native \nlanguage, since languages may have differing word counts in their native and translated forms.  \nThis count will be absent if no native dictionaries yielded a match for the document. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1SHARINGIMAGE.  (textual URL)  Many news websites specify a so-called “sharing image” for \neach article in which the news outlet manually specifies a particular image to be displayed when \nthat article is shared via social media or other formats.  Not all news outlets specify a sharing \nimage and some sites simply use their logo, but for those that do use this field, it represents the \noutlet’s selection of the single image that best captures the overall focus and contents of the \nstory.  GDELT currently recognizes a variety of formats for specifying this image, including Open \nGraph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats, among others.  \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1RELATEDIMAGES.  (semicolon-delimited list of URLs).  News articles frequently include \nphotographs, figures, and other imagery to illustrate the story, ranging from a single illustrative \nphotograph at top, to lengthy photo essays interspersed through the entirety of an article.  Such \nimagery lends a rich visual tapestry to a news report, helping to clarify, for example, whether an \narticle about a “protest blocking a highway” involves hundreds of activists along its length, or \njust a handful of people in one location, or whether a gas explosion leveled a building or merely \nshattered its windows.  GDELT uses a suite of highly sophisticated algorithms to actually “read” \nthrough each article in the way a human would, evaluating each image on to determine its \nrelevance, based on positioning, captioning, referencing, and context, and compiles a list of the \nURLs of the images it deems to be most relevant to the article.  Thus, unrelated inset boxes, \nadvertisements, and other imagery are ignored and this field contains only a list of images most \nillustrative of the core of the story.  This feature is in alpha release and involves a number of \nhighly complex algorithms working together in concert and thus may make mistakes.  We will be \nimproving this algorithm over time and would appreciate any feedback you may have on the \nkinds of images it incorrectly includes and those that it misses. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1SOCIALIMAGEEMBEDS.  (semicolon-delimited list of URLs).  News websites are increasingly \nembedding image-based social media posts inline in their articles to illustrate them with \nrealtime reaction or citizen reporting from the ground.  GDELT currently recognizes embedded \nimage-based Twitter and Instagram posts and records their URLs in this field.  Only those posts \ncontaining imagery are included in this field.  This acts as a form of social media “curation” in \nwhich news outlets are wading through the deluge of social media reaction or reporting about a \nspecific situation and hand-selecting key image posts deemed of greatest relevance, \n                                                          \n8 http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/GCAM-MASTERCODEBOOK.xlsx'
 'of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html'
 '[23, 28].\nThroughout this work we use the GDELT dataset as a case study.\nGDELT is a massive collection of\nnews reports that provide a real-time computational record of global events that is published every 15\nminutes. It aggregates information from various news sources, blogs, and social media platforms to construct\na large collection of data including information on people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions.\nEssentially, GDELT offers a snapshot of the world’s collective events, enabling researchers and analysts to\nexplore complex patterns and relationships within global society. By analyzing this data, it’s possible to\nidentify emerging trends, assess risks, understand public sentiment, and track the evolution of various issues\nover time. The applications of GDELT are diverse and far-reaching. Some of the most common use cases\nincluding event monitoring [16, 17, 29], risk assessment and prediction [6, 19, 20, 24, 26, 30], and social\nscience research [2, 3, 4, 12].\nGDELT describes its structure as a Global Knowledge Graph (GKG, specifically, we use the the Global\nKnowledge Graph edition 2 (GKG2) of GDELT).

Higher cosine similarity indicates a greater\nsemantic similarity between the predicted and actual answers.\nraw documents or a curated KG should not be of ‘Either/Or’, but rather integration between these two\nmodalities. Our findings demonstrate the significant value of combining the strengths of both approaches.\nWe believe that by combining news articles in the form of a vector store with the rich ontological structure of\nthe GDELT knowledge graph through an LLM interface, the resulting information extraction system would\nallow for better knowledge retrieval than either component alone. Specifically, the direct knowledge graph\n(DKG) excels at answering high-level or aggregate questions, providing a strong foundation of structured\nknowledge. While the vector store is well-suited for identifying local information within the documents that\nmight be missing or less readily accessible in the DKG, GraphRAG has shown effectiveness on both local and\nglobal information. Therefore, we hypothesize that the optimal approach is the integrated system, leveraging\nthe DKG for broad context and the vector store and GraphRAG for detailed, document-specific insights,\nand for enhanced global information retrieval. Further work must be done to determine the extent to which\nthe textual article data can be used to refine the KG produced here; some of our examples showed that\ninformation stored in the DKG does not truthfully reflect the information in the articles. Conversely, we\nmust determine how the constructed KG can be used to better search the associated vector store. Some of\nthese research directions include the following:\n• Use LLMs to add new information to an existing KG by creating new entities or edge relations. Based\noff our observations with LlamaIndex and GraphRAG, we need careful monitoring to ensure that the\nLLM formats its responses to properly adhere to the ontological structures and other existing structures\nin the KG. To this end, it can be beneficial to adapt the triples in the DKG produced here to fine-tune\nthe language model or guide its output with in-context learning.\n• By introducing RAG capabilities, we can fact check the KG against the raw textual information. For\nexample, we found that Niki Fennoy was only mentioned in 3 articles but misattributed to 11 others.\nThe use of LLMs give a potential avenue to fact-check existing relations.\n5\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is under information release number PNNL-SA-209193.\n10']","['adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening entirely new analytic opportunities.

In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing Person and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, such as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World Cup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran Nuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative. Finally, GDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the evolving language used by political leadership across the world. \uf0b7']","Lexicoder contributes to the realtime measurement of emotions and themes in the GDELT Global Content Analysis Measures (GCAM) module by providing one of the emotional measurement packages used within GCAM.

How does the GKG handle Date Mentions and what is the role of Proximity Context in this process?,"['• Solid edges indicate a field in a relational table and are labeled with the type of semantic relation.\n• Dashed and bold edges indicate the structural, one-to-many relations in the relational schema.\nThe naming convention also captures the unique identifier for these csv files, so that ⟨GLOBALEVENTID⟩\nidentifies unique Events, the pair (⟨GLOBALEVENTID⟩, ⟨MentionIdentifier⟩) identifies unique Mentions, as\ndoes ⟨DocumentIdentifier⟩for Articles. We again note that the document and mention identifiers are the\nsame field, but have different field names (e.g., a URL is typically used for the document identifier and the\nsame URL is used for the mention identifier).\n3\nCase Study - Baltimore Bridge Collapse\nHere we will provide an analysis of data collected over a recent and short period of time to do question-\nanswering based analysis. The point of collecting recent data is that the LLMs used have not yet been\ntrained on these events (at the time of this study) and thus the knowledge systems are needed to supply\nthe LLM with relevant information. Specifically, this analysis uses a subset of the GDELT data collected\non March 26th of 2024 from 12:00 AM to 10:00 AM during and after the collapse of the Francis Scott Key\nBridge in Baltimore, Maryland, which occurred at approximately 1:29 AM. This 10 hour window of time\ncaptures the media response to this disaster. We filtered down the collected mentions data to only include\nrows in any of the related data if it included any of the keywords “Baltimore”, “bridge”, “collapse”, or\n“ship”. We then used all GLOBALEVENTIDs and MentionIdentifiers in this reduced mentions file to collect\nthe relevant events and articles. This filtration resulted in using approximately 1.33% of the available data\nwith 371 events, 2047 mentions, and 209 articles.\n3.1\nGDELT Knowledge Graphs\nUsing the GDELT data directly and the scraped text we can construct a total of three KGs:\nDirect KG (DKG): The first KG was simply a direct conversion of the subset of the original GDELT data\ninto an equivalent KG as specified by our ontology in Fig. 3. This KG is shown in Fig. 4a.\nLlamaIndex KG (LKG): The second KG was generated by an LLM deployed against a text corpus con-\nsisting of the source articles collected by scraping URLs of the 209 articles included in our GDELT\nsubset, and enriched with knowledge of the ontology. This KG is shown in Fig. 4b.\nGraphRAG KG (GRKG): The final KG was generated using the same articles as the LKG, using Mi-\ncrosoft’s open-source GraphRAG package with default configuration parameters. This KG is shown in\nFig. 4c.\nThe example KG constructed using our ontology (DKG) is shown in a reduced form in Fig. 4a. The nodes\nare color coded based on their source. Note that node and edge labels are not shown in order to facilitate\nclarity. This KG is one component and has 3,469 nodes and 18,052 edges.\nTo construct a KG directly from the corpus of source document text (LKG) shown in Fig. 4b, we used\nMixtral-8x7B [11] as our base model, following the procedure outlined by the LlamaIndex package developers\n[1]. The LLM is prompted to extract triples from the news articles according to a prompt provided in the\nparameter kg triplet prompt. Using the default prompt, the ontology does not get incorporated and the\nresulting KG is a star-shaped graph with a single central node and all other nodes connected to this center,\nthere being no other edges. When we change the prompt to consider the entire ontology, we again get a\nstar-shaped graph. Nontrivial graph structure arose when we prompted the language model with a reduced\nversion of the ontology with adaptation for unstructured text. In particular, our prompt asked for:\n• Vertices of one of the following types: “Event”, “Article”, “Mention”, “Person”, “Quotation”, “Orga-\nnization”, “Location”, and “Other”, with the last type serving as a catch-all.\n5'
 'Finally, a set of fields at the end of the record provide additional data management information for the \nevent record.   \n \n\uf0b7 \nDATEADDED. (integer) This field stores the date the event was added to the master database \nin YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format in the UTC timezone.  For those needing to access events at 15 \nminute resolution, this is the field that should be used in queries. \n\uf0b7 \nSOURCEURL.  (string) This field records the URL or citation of the first news report it found this \nevent in.  In most cases this is the first report it saw the article in, but due to the timing and \nflow of news reports through the processing pipeline, this may not always be the very first \nreport, but is at least in the first few reports. \n \n \n \nMENTIONS TABLE \n \nThe Mentions table is a new addition to GDELT 2.0 and records each mention of the events in the Event \ntable, making it possible to track the trajectory and network structure of a story as it flows through the \nglobal media system.  Each mention of an event receives its own entry in the Mentions table – thus an \nevent which is mentioned in 100 articles will be listed 100 times in the Mentions table.  Mentions are \nrecorded irrespective of the date of the original event, meaning that a mention today of an event from a \nyear ago will still be recorded, making it possible to trace discussion of “anniversary events” or historical \nevents being recontextualized into present actions.  If a news report mentions multiple events, each \nmention is recorded separately in this table.  For translated documents, all measures below are based \non its English translation. \n \nSeveral of the new measures recorded in the Mentions table make it possible to better filter events \nbased on how confident GDELT was in its extraction of that event.  When trying to understand news \nmedia spanning the entire globe, one finds that journalism is rife with ambiguities, assumed background \nknowledge, and complex linguistic structures.  Not every event mention will take the form of “American \nPresident Barack Obama met with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday at a trade summit in Paris, \nFrance.”  Instead, an event mention might more commonly appear as “Obama and Putin were in Paris \nyesterday for a trade summit.  The two leaders met backstage where he discussed his policy on \nUkraine.”  To which of the two leader(s) do “he” and “his” refer?  Is Obama discussing Obama’s policy on \nUkraine, or is Obama discussing Putin’s policy on Ukraine, or is it Putin discussing Putin’s policy or \nperhaps Putin discussing Obama’s policy?  While additional cues may be available in the surrounding \ntext, ambiguous event mentions like this are exceptionally common across the world’s media.  Similarly, \nit would be difficult indeed to maintain an exhaustive list of every single political figure in the entire \nworld and thus context is often critical for disambiguating the geographic affiliation of an actor.  Even in \nthe case of more senior political leadership, a reference to “Renauld’s press conference this afternoon in \nPort-au-Prince” most likely refers to Lener Renauld, the Minister of Defense of Haiti, but this \ndisambiguation still carries with it some degree of ambiguity.  GDELT makes use of an array of natural \nlanguage processing algorithms like coreference and deep parsing using whole-of-document context.  \nWhile these enormously increase GDELT’s ability to understand and extract ambiguous and linguistically \ncomplex events, such extractions also come with a higher potential for error.  Under GDELT 1.0, the \nNumMentions field as designed as a composite score of the absolute number of unique documents \nmentioning an event and the number of revisions to the text required by these various algorithms, up to \nsix revision passes.  Under GDELT 2.0, the Mentions table now separates these, with each record in the \nMentions table recording an individual mention of an event in an article, while the new Confidence field'
 'of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html'
 '2\nConstructing a Knowledge Graph for GDELT\nAs previously mentioned, while the GDELT-GKG2 dataset is not actually natively in the form of a knowledge\ngraph, it is advertised and frequently cited as being one. We believe that we are making a distinct contribution\nto the research community by converting the very popular GKG2 database into a proper KG.\nGKG2 is natively a database of three related tables:\n• expert.csv captures event information;\n• GKG.csv captures article information; and\n• mentions.csv relates which articles mention which events.\nFigure 2: GDELT GKG 2.0 schema relating articles (GKG), mentions, and events (Export).\nThe database schema for these three CSV files is shown in Fig. 2 (see also [9]). The key characteristics of\nthis database relational schema should be interpreted as follows:\n• The three tables are color-coded by Events (green), Mentions (pink), and Articles (blue).\n• The single table of Events is shown in multiple green sub-tables, simply for clarity and convenience to\nlayout a long record structure.\n• Single-headed arrows represent one-to-many relationships between the tables. Specifically:\n– Each Event maps to multiple Mentions via the shared GLOBALEVENTID field.\n– Each Article maps to multiple Mentions via the DocumentIdentifer field on the Article side\nmatching to the MentionIdentifier field on the Mention side.\n• In this way, the Mentions table acts as a “pairs file” recording a many-many relation between Events\nand Articles: each event can be mentioned in multiple articles, and dually each article can men-\ntion many events. Each Article also has both a unique identifier through the GKGRECORDID or the\nDocumentIdentifer fields, since each row in the GKG data represents a single article.\n3'

Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the introduction of the new Proximity Context capability. The GKG records an enormously rich array']","The GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) handles Date Mentions primarily through timestamp fields in the Mentions and Events tables, and it uses Proximity Context to improve the association and disambiguation of entities and their attributes within articles.

**Handling of Date Mentions:**

- The **Mentions table** records each individual mention of an event in an article, including timestamps related to the event and the mention itself.
- Two key date/time fields are used:
  - **EventTimeDate:** This is a 15-minute resolution timestamp (in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format) indicating when the event was first recorded by GDELT.
  - **MentionTimeDate:** This is also a 15-minute resolution timestamp indicating when the mention (i.e., the current update or article mention) was recorded.
- These timestamps allow tracking of when events occurred and when they were mentioned in the media, enabling analysis of the trajectory and timing of news coverage.
- The **DATEADDED** field in the event record stores when the event was added to the master database, also in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS UTC format, useful for querying events at fine temporal resolution.

**Role of Proximity Context:**

- GKG 2.1 introduces approximate **character offsets** for each reference to an object (e.g., person, location, organization) within the original article text.
- This proximity information allows for **simple proximity-based contextualization**, meaning that entities mentioned close together in the text are more likely to be related.
- For example, if ""United States"" appears near ""Barack Obama"" and ""John Kerry"" but farther from ""Vladimir Putin,"" the system can infer stronger associations between the U.S. and the first two individuals.
- Similarly, functional roles or thematic contexts (like ""Secretary of State"") can be linked to the closest relevant person mentioned.
- This proximity-based approach helps disambiguate ambiguous references and associate dates, roles, locations, and other attributes more accurately within the text.
- Pilot tests have shown that these proximity indicators are effective at recovering functional, thematic, and geographic affiliations, which is critical for correctly interpreting date mentions and other event details in complex or ambiguous news narratives.

**Summary:**

- Date mentions in GKG are managed through precise timestamp fields at both the event and mention levels, enabling temporal tracking of events and their media mentions.
- Proximity Context, via character offsets in the text, plays a crucial role in associating date mentions and other attributes with the correct entities by leveraging their closeness in the article, thereby improving the semantic accuracy of the knowledge graph.","The GKG extracts all day, month, and year dates from each document to encode the list of date references found in news articles and documents, aiming to identify repeating mentions of specific dates as possible “anniversary violence” indicators.

GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents \nand reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from \nLIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Translation of 65 Languages.  GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n\uf0b7 \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.  A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now \nspecify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that \nrepresents the core focus of the article.  GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.  This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations \nanywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act \nas a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \n\uf0b7 \nQuotes, Names, and Amounts.

 '[23, 28].\nThroughout this work we use the GDELT dataset as a case study.\nGDELT is a massive collection of\nnews reports that provide a real-time computational record of global events that is published every 15\nminutes. It aggregates information from various news sources, blogs, and social media platforms to construct\na large collection of data including information on people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions.\nEssentially, GDELT offers a snapshot of the world’s collective events, enabling researchers and analysts to\nexplore complex patterns and relationships within global society. By analyzing this data, it’s possible to\nidentify emerging trends, assess risks, understand public sentiment, and track the evolution of various issues\nover time. The applications of GDELT are diverse and far-reaching. Some of the most common use cases\nincluding event monitoring [16, 17, 29], risk assessment and prediction [6, 19, 20, 24, 26, 30], and social\nscience research [2, 3, 4, 12].\nGDELT describes its structure as a Global Knowledge Graph (GKG, specifically, we use the the Global\nKnowledge Graph edition 2 (GKG2) of GDELT). But in fact GDELT-GKG2 is implemented as multiple\nlinked tables recording information about the relationship between articles and events, and thus effectively\nhas the structure of a relational database. Another important contribution of this paper is to actually realize\nGKG2 properly in the mathematical form of a KG, effectively a graph database, derived from and consistent\nwith its native relational database form. To facilitate this effort, we have identified a lightweight ontology\nfor GDELT in the form of its graph schema, realizing its relational database schema in a KG form.\nUsing the KG that we construct from the GDELT-GKG2 dataset, we provide a case study to explore the\nutility of LLM-based tools to extract information and confirm that the KG can be used for question-answering\nin cases where traditional RAG fails. As part of our analysis, we compare to KGs produced from processing\nvarious news articles with an LLM, prompting it to try and adhere to a reduced version of the same ontology.\nThe current state of neurosymbolic work is noted for the plethora of experimental architectures available.\nWhile details are explicated below in Section 3.2, we preview ours in Figure 1, including the five method-\nological pathways which are quantitatively compared: 1) graph queries on the KG (called the DKG) derived\n“directly” from GKG2; 2) use of G-Retriever2 [7] against the same DKG; 3) RAG against a vector store\nrepresentation of GKG2; 4) G-Retriever against a second KG (called the LKG) derived from using Llamain-\ndex3 [1] against the GDELT source articles; and 5) GraphRAG4 Q&A deployed against a third KG (called\nGRKG) using Microsoft’s open-source GraphRAG package with default configuration parameters.\nFigure 1: Pipeline of different experiments ran to analyze the GDELT database using an LLM.\n2https://github.com/XiaoxinHe/G-Retriever\n3https://www.llamaindex.ai/\n4https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/\n2'

Higher cosine similarity indicates a greater\nsemantic similarity between the predicted and actual answers.\nraw documents or a curated KG should not be of ‘Either/Or’, but rather integration between these two\nmodalities. Our findings demonstrate the significant value of combining the strengths of both approaches.\nWe believe that by combining news articles in the form of a vector store with the rich ontological structure of\nthe GDELT knowledge graph through an LLM interface, the resulting information extraction system would\nallow for better knowledge retrieval than either component alone. Specifically, the direct knowledge graph\n(DKG) excels at answering high-level or aggregate questions, providing a strong foundation of structured\nknowledge. While the vector store is well-suited for identifying local information within the documents that\nmight be missing or less readily accessible in the DKG, GraphRAG has shown effectiveness on both local and\nglobal information. Therefore, we hypothesize that the optimal approach is the integrated system, leveraging\nthe DKG for broad context and the vector store and GraphRAG for detailed, document-specific insights,\nand for enhanced global information retrieval. Further work must be done to determine the extent to which\nthe textual article data can be used to refine the KG produced here; some of our examples showed that\ninformation stored in the DKG does not truthfully reflect the information in the articles. Conversely, we\nmust determine how the constructed KG can be used to better search the associated vector store. Some of\nthese research directions include the following:\n• Use LLMs to add new information to an existing KG by creating new entities or edge relations. Based\noff our observations with LlamaIndex and GraphRAG, we need careful monitoring to ensure that the\nLLM formats its responses to properly adhere to the ontological structures and other existing structures\nin the KG. To this end, it can be beneficial to adapt the triples in the DKG produced here to fine-tune\nthe language model or guide its output with in-context learning.\n• By introducing RAG capabilities, we can fact check the KG against the raw textual information.

However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html'
 'arXiv:2503.07584v3  [cs.IR]  24 Jun 2025\nTalking to GDELT Through Knowledge Graphs\nAudun Myers, Max Vargas, Sinan G. Aksoy, Cliff Joslyn, Benjamin Wilson,\nLee Burke, Tom Grimes\nAbstract\nIn this work we study various Retrieval Augmented Regeneration (RAG) approaches to gain an\nunderstanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in a question-answering analysis. To\ngain this understanding we use a case-study subset of the Global Database of Events, Language, and\nTone (GDELT) dataset as well as a corpus of raw text scraped from the online news articles. To retrieve\ninformation from the text corpus we implement a traditional vector store RAG as well as state-of-the-art\nlarge language model (LLM) based approaches for automatically constructing KGs and retrieving the\nrelevant subgraphs. In addition to these corpus approaches, we develop a novel ontology-based framework\nfor constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from GDELT directly which leverages the underlying schema\nof GDELT to create structured representations of global events. For retrieving relevant information from\nthe ontology-based KGs we implement both direct graph queries and state-of-the-art graph retrieval\napproaches. We compare the performance of each method in a question-answering task. We find that\nwhile our ontology-based KGs are valuable for question-answering, automated extraction of the relevant\nsubgraphs is challenging. Conversely, LLM-generated KGs, while capturing event summaries, often lack\nconsistency and interpretability. Our findings suggest benefits of a synergistic approach between ontology\nand LLM-based KG construction, with proposed avenues toward that end.\n1\nIntroduction\nIn this work we study several approaches for communicating with a corpus of text via relevant text and\nknowledge graph (KG) representation and retrieval facilitated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our\ngoal is to understand the benefits and drawbacks of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches to\ncorpus management and anlysis when combined with an LLM. Throughout we use as a case study a novel\nKG derived from the Global Data on Events, Location, and Tone (GDELT)1 [13] dataset.\nAs a way to enhance LLM outputs, researchers and practitioners have been quick in applying LLMs to\nquery and understand proprietary data through retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) [14]. It has been\nshown that reasoning over the typical RAG framework, which only takes advantage of the unstructured text\narticles, fails to capture global information about the provided data [5, 27].\nMotivated by this limitation, there has been recent interest in adapting these techniques to the case where\nour data has a graph structure, so that the LLM can directly ingest important relationships in the knowledge\nbase [5, 7, 15, 31]. More specifically, KGs [8] are graph structures which are richly attributed with typing\nand semantic information on both nodes and edges. KG techniques provide ways to automatically query\nand extract information stored in a KG without the user explicitly needing to understand query languages\nto probe their knowledge base. Typically, these AI-based search algorithms find subgraphs that can be used\nto answer a user-provided query.\nThe interactions between KGs and LLMs have potential beyond merely question-answering and knowledge\nextraction (see different research directions outlined by Pan et al. [18]). In particular, reflective of KGs\nbeing used to enhance LLM outputs, LLMs can be used to enhance existing KGs or create new ones entirely\nfrom scratch. However, exploration of techniques to this end either (1) do not deal with imposing different\nontological structures in graph creation or (2) only focus on extracting ontological structures using LLMs\n1https://www.gdeltproject.org/\n1']","['<1-hop>\n\nINTRODUCTION This codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands GDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards actually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news. It applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to compute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document. To sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening around the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every single day. It has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system on November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an incredible number and diversity of fields. The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent dimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly unimaginable new applications. We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and capabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we are both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original alpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. Due to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create a raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of software packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely complex analytic needs in a single file. Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for direct import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated preprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to extract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package. Thus, users may require more advanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance may be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and network and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook. Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, or other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and size (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in these formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file format needed. The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab- delimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized streamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG. Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, despite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or “.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. The new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards compatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but'
 '<2-hop>\n\nadds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening entirely new analytic opportunities. Some of the most significant changes: \uf0b7 Realtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes. The GDELT Global Content Analysis Measures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment analysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual dimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, French, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Urdu). GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents and reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from LIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \uf0b7 Realtime Translation of 65 Languages. GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT Translingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine translation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, representing 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into English for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines. GDELT Translingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the very first glimpses of a world without language barriers. The GKG system now processes every news report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \uf0b7 Relevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds. A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now specify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that represents the core focus of the article. GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats including Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats. In addition, GDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to identify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded social media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is compiled. This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations anywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act as a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \uf0b7 Quotes, Names, and Amounts. The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food prices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable item. GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to offer numeric context to global events. In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing Person and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, such as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World Cup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran Nuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative. Finally, GDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the evolving language used by political leadership across the world. \uf0b7']","The natural language processing (NLP) algorithms employed in the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) enable comprehensive sentiment analysis across multiple languages primarily through the integration of two key components: the GDELT Global Content Analysis Measures (GCAM) module and the GDELT Translingual system.

**How NLP Algorithms Enable Multilingual Sentiment Analysis:**

1. **GCAM Module for Emotion and Theme Measurement:**  
   - GCAM represents one of the largest deployments of sentiment analysis globally, combining 24 emotional measurement packages.  
   - It assesses over 2,300 emotions and themes in real time from every article processed.  
   - Crucially, GCAM natively supports 15 languages (including Arabic, Chinese, French, Hindi, Russian, Spanish, and others), allowing direct emotional assessment without relying solely on translation.  
   - The module incorporates diverse emotional dimensions from established lexicons and tools such as LIWC (e.g., “Anxiety”), Lexicoder (e.g., “Positivity”), WordNet Affect (e.g., “Smugness”), and RID (e.g., “Passivity”), enabling a rich, nuanced understanding of emotional content.

2. **GDELT Translingual System for Real-Time Translation:**  
   - GDELT Translingual provides real-time machine translation of news content from 65 languages into English, covering 98.4% of non-English news volume monitored by GDELT.  
   - This massive streaming translation capability allows the entire GKG pipeline—including event detection and sentiment analysis—to process global news without language barriers.  
   - By translating a broad array of languages into a common language (English), it enables consistent processing and integration of sentiment and thematic data across diverse linguistic sources.

**New Analytic Opportunities from Integrating GCAM and GDELT Translingual:**

- **Planetary-Scale Emotional Underpinning Analysis:**  
  The combination of native multilingual emotional assessment (GCAM) and extensive real-time translation (Translingual) allows GDELT to capture and analyze emotional undercurrents globally at an unprecedented scale and granularity. This enables researchers and analysts to track how emotions and themes evolve across different cultures and languages simultaneously.

- **Cross-Language and Cross-Media Tracing:**  
  The system can trace people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems, providing a unified view of global sentiment dynamics that was previously impossible due to language fragmentation.

- **Real-Time Monitoring of Global Emotional Reactions:**  
  The real-time nature of both GCAM’s sentiment measurement and Translingual’s translation allows for immediate detection of shifts in public mood, anxiety, positivity, or other emotional states worldwide, facilitating timely responses to emerging events.

- **Enhanced Contextual and Thematic Insights:**  
  By integrating a wide array of emotional dimensions and themes, the system supports complex analyses that go beyond simple positive/negative sentiment, capturing subtle emotional nuances and thematic contexts that inform deeper understanding of global social and political climates.

- **Support for Advanced Knowledge Graph and AI Applications:**  
  The enriched emotional and thematic data feed into the GKG’s structured knowledge graph, enabling sophisticated querying, retrieval, and reasoning about global events and sentiments. This supports advanced AI-driven analytics, including question-answering, trend detection, and risk assessment.

In summary, the NLP algorithms in GDELT’s GKG leverage native multilingual sentiment analysis through GCAM and extensive real-time translation via the Translingual system to provide a comprehensive, real-time, and multilingual emotional mapping of global news. This integration opens new analytic opportunities for understanding global emotional undercurrents, enabling researchers and decision-makers to monitor, analyze, and respond to worldwide sentiment shifts with unprecedented scope and immediacy.","The GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1 applies a sophisticated array of natural language processing algorithms to each document, enabling the computation of codified metadata that captures latent and contextual dimensions of global news. These algorithms connect entities such as persons, organizations, locations, themes, and events into a massive network that reflects not only what is happening worldwide but also the emotional context and sentiment surrounding these events. The integration of the GDELT Global Content Analysis Measures (GCAM) module significantly enhances sentiment analysis by deploying what is believed to be the largest sentiment analysis system globally, assessing over 2,300 emotions and themes in real time. GCAM incorporates 24 emotional measurement packages that evaluate emotions across 15 languages natively, including Arabic, Chinese, French, Hindi, Russian, and Spanish, among others. Complementing this, the GDELT Translingual system translates news from 65 languages in real time into English, covering 98.4% of non-English monitoring volume, thus overcoming language barriers and enabling comprehensive multilingual sentiment assessment. Together, these advancements open entirely new analytic opportunities by allowing unparalleled real-time measurement of emotional undercurrents and reactions at a planetary scale, facilitating the tracing of people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems.",0.8392857142857143,0.9522280338844625,0.9999999999,1.0
"How does the use of the DATEADDED field in event sourcing complement the detailed event tracking capabilities provided by the Mentions table in GDELT 2.0, particularly in managing the temporal resolution and network structure of news events?","['Finally, a set of fields at the end of the record provide additional data management information for the \nevent record.   \n \n\uf0b7 \nDATEADDED. (integer) This field stores the date the event was added to the master database \nin YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format in the UTC timezone.  For those needing to access events at 15 \nminute resolution, this is the field that should be used in queries. \n\uf0b7 \nSOURCEURL.  (string) This field records the URL or citation of the first news report it found this \nevent in.  In most cases this is the first report it saw the article in, but due to the timing and \nflow of news reports through the processing pipeline, this may not always be the very first \nreport, but is at least in the first few reports. \n \n \n \nMENTIONS TABLE \n \nThe Mentions table is a new addition to GDELT 2.0 and records each mention of the events in the Event \ntable, making it possible to track the trajectory and network structure of a story as it flows through the \nglobal media system.  Each mention of an event receives its own entry in the Mentions table – thus an \nevent which is mentioned in 100 articles will be listed 100 times in the Mentions table.  Mentions are \nrecorded irrespective of the date of the original event, meaning that a mention today of an event from a \nyear ago will still be recorded, making it possible to trace discussion of “anniversary events” or historical \nevents being recontextualized into present actions.  If a news report mentions multiple events, each \nmention is recorded separately in this table.  For translated documents, all measures below are based \non its English translation. \n \nSeveral of the new measures recorded in the Mentions table make it possible to better filter events \nbased on how confident GDELT was in its extraction of that event.  When trying to understand news \nmedia spanning the entire globe, one finds that journalism is rife with ambiguities, assumed background \nknowledge, and complex linguistic structures.  Not every event mention will take the form of “American \nPresident Barack Obama met with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday at a trade summit in Paris, \nFrance.”  Instead, an event mention might more commonly appear as “Obama and Putin were in Paris \nyesterday for a trade summit.  The two leaders met backstage where he discussed his policy on \nUkraine.”  To which of the two leader(s) do “he” and “his” refer?  Is Obama discussing Obama’s policy on \nUkraine, or is Obama discussing Putin’s policy on Ukraine, or is it Putin discussing Putin’s policy or \nperhaps Putin discussing Obama’s policy?  While additional cues may be available in the surrounding \ntext, ambiguous event mentions like this are exceptionally common across the world’s media.  Similarly, \nit would be difficult indeed to maintain an exhaustive list of every single political figure in the entire \nworld and thus context is often critical for disambiguating the geographic affiliation of an actor.  Even in \nthe case of more senior political leadership, a reference to “Renauld’s press conference this afternoon in \nPort-au-Prince” most likely refers to Lener Renauld, the Minister of Defense of Haiti, but this \ndisambiguation still carries with it some degree of ambiguity.  GDELT makes use of an array of natural \nlanguage processing algorithms like coreference and deep parsing using whole-of-document context.  \nWhile these enormously increase GDELT’s ability to understand and extract ambiguous and linguistically \ncomplex events, such extractions also come with a higher potential for error.  Under GDELT 1.0, the \nNumMentions field as designed as a composite score of the absolute number of unique documents \nmentioning an event and the number of revisions to the text required by these various algorithms, up to \nsix revision passes.  Under GDELT 2.0, the Mentions table now separates these, with each record in the \nMentions table recording an individual mention of an event in an article, while the new Confidence field'
 'THE GDELT EVENT DATABASE \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.0 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their \ndescriptions.  GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, \ncapturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2.  A wide array of variables break \nout the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, \nthe Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique \narray of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both \nactors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the \nstory of each event “in flight” through the global media system. \n \nAt present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, \nhowever in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 \nformat.  The   Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note \nthat files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited).   \n \nWith the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at \nleast through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without \nmodification.  Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning \nFebruary 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches \nback to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. \n  \nThere are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset.  The first is the \ntraditional Event table.  This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several \nchanges as noted below.  In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records \nall mentions of each event.  As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those \nmentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, \nincluding the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus \nbeing buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event \nfrom that specific news report.  The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it \npossible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases.  Those wishing to find the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of \nperiod “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest \nevents with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the \nhighest Confidence measures.  This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each \nindividual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below).  It also makes it possible to \nidentify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those \nwith the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific \nsource language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).'
 'records GDELT’s confidence in its extraction of that event from that particular article.  This field is a \npercent, ranging from 10 to 100% and indicates how aggressively GDELT had to perform tasks like \ncoreference or grammatical restructuring to extract the event from that article.  Sorting all mentions of \nan event by this field makes it possible to identify articles featuring the strongest and most \nunambiguous discussion of an event. \n \n\uf0b7 \nGlobalEventID.  (integer)  This is the ID of the event that was mentioned in the article. \n\uf0b7 \nEventTimeDate.  (integer)  This is the 15-minute timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) when the \nevent being mentioned was first recorded by GDELT (the DATEADDED field of the original event \nrecord).  This field can be compared against the next one to identify events being mentioned for \nthe first time (their first mentions) or to identify events of a particular vintage being mentioned \nnow (such as filtering for mentions of events at least one week old). \n\uf0b7 \nMentionTimeDate.  (integer)  This is the 15-minute timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) of the \ncurrent update.  This is identical for all entries in the update file but is included to make it easier \nto load the Mentions table into a database.   \n\uf0b7 \nMentionType.  (integer)  This is a numeric identifier that refers to the source collection the \ndocument came from and is used to interpret the MentionIdentifier in the next column.  In \nessence, it specifies how to interpret the MentionIdentifier to locate the actual document.  At \npresent, it can hold one of the following values: \no 1 = WEB (The document originates from the open web and the MentionIdentifier is a \nfully-qualified URL that can be used to access the document on the web). \no 2 = CITATIONONLY (The document originates from a broadcast, print, or other offline \nsource in which only a textual citation is available for the document.  In this case the \nMentionIdentifier contains the textual citation for the document). \no 3 = CORE (The document originates from the CORE archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through the CORE \nwebsite). \no 4 = DTIC (The document originates from the DTIC archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through the DTIC website). \no 5 = JSTOR (The document originates from the JSTOR archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through your JSTOR \nsubscription if your institution subscribes to it). \no 6 = NONTEXTUALSOURCE (The document originates from a textual proxy (such as closed \ncaptioning) of a non-textual information source (such as a video) available via a URL and \nthe MentionIdentifier provides the URL of the non-textual original source.  At present, \nthis Collection Identifier is used for processing of the closed captioning streams of the \nInternet Archive Television News Archive in which each broadcast is available via a URL, \nbut the URL offers access only to the video of the broadcast and does not provide any \naccess to the textual closed captioning used to generate the metadata.  This code is \nused in order to draw a distinction between URL-based textual material (Collection \nIdentifier 1 (WEB) and URL-based non-textual material like the Television News Archive). \n\uf0b7 \nMentionSourceName.  (integer)  This is a human-friendly identifier of the source of the \ndocument.  For material originating from the open web with a URL this field will contain the top-\nlevel domain the page was from.  For BBC Monitoring material it will contain “BBC Monitoring” \nand for JSTOR material it will contain “JSTOR.”  This field is intended for human display of major \nsources as well as for network analysis of information flows by source, obviating the \nrequirement to perform domain or other parsing of the MentionIdentifier field.'
 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.

(integer) This field stores the date the event was added to the master database in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format in the UTC timezone. For those needing to access events at 15 minute resolution, this is the field that should be used in queries. \uf0b7 SOURCEURL. (string) This field records the URL or citation of the first news report it found this event in. In most cases this is the first report it saw the article in, but due to the timing and flow of news reports through the processing pipeline, this may not always be the very first report, but is at least in the first few reports.'
 '<2-hop>\n\nMENTIONS TABLE The Mentions table is a new addition to GDELT 2.0 and records each mention of the events in the Event table, making it possible to track the trajectory and network structure of a story as it flows through the global media system. Each mention of an event receives its own entry in the Mentions table – thus an event which is mentioned in 100 articles will be listed 100 times in the Mentions table. Mentions are recorded irrespective of the date of the original event, meaning that a mention today of an event from a year ago will still be recorded, making it possible to trace discussion of “anniversary events” or historical events being recontextualized into present actions. If a news report mentions multiple events, each mention is recorded separately in this table. For translated documents, all measures below are based on its English translation. Several of the new measures recorded in the Mentions table make it possible to better filter events based on how confident GDELT was in its extraction of that event. When trying to understand news media spanning the entire globe, one finds that journalism is rife with ambiguities, assumed background knowledge, and complex linguistic structures. Not every event mention will take the form of “American President Barack Obama met with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday at a trade summit in Paris, France.” Instead, an event mention might more commonly appear as “Obama and Putin were in Paris yesterday for a trade summit. The two leaders met backstage where he discussed his policy on Ukraine.” To which of the two leader(s) do “he” and “his” refer? Is Obama discussing Obama’s policy on Ukraine, or is Obama discussing Putin’s policy on Ukraine, or is it Putin discussing Putin’s policy or perhaps Putin discussing Obama’s policy? While additional cues may be available in the surrounding text, ambiguous event mentions like this are exceptionally common across the world’s media. Similarly, it would be difficult indeed to maintain an exhaustive list of every single political figure in the entire world and thus context is often critical for disambiguating the geographic affiliation of an actor. Even in the case of more senior political leadership, a reference to “Renauld’s press conference this afternoon in Port-au-Prince” most likely refers to Lener Renauld, the Minister of Defense of Haiti, but this disambiguation still carries with it some degree of ambiguity. GDELT makes use of an array of natural language processing algorithms like coreference and deep parsing using whole-of-document context. While these enormously increase GDELT’s ability to understand and extract ambiguous and linguistically complex events, such extractions also come with a higher potential for error. Under GDELT 1.0, the NumMentions field as designed as a composite score of the absolute number of unique documents mentioning an event and the number of revisions to the text required by these various algorithms, up to six revision passes. Under GDELT 2.0, the Mentions table now separates these, with each record in the Mentions table recording an individual mention of an event in an article, while the new Confidence field']","The use of the **DATEADDED** field in event sourcing complements the detailed event tracking capabilities provided by the **Mentions** table in GDELT 2.0 by enabling precise temporal management and enhancing the understanding of the network structure of news events as they unfold over time.

### Temporal Resolution Management

- **DATEADDED** records the exact timestamp (in UTC, YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format) when an event was added to the master database. This timestamp provides a fine-grained temporal resolution of 15 minutes, which is critical for querying and analyzing events with high temporal precision.
- By using **DATEADDED**, users can filter and access events based on when they were first recorded, allowing for near real-time tracking of breaking news or historical event analysis at a granular time scale.
- In the **Mentions** table, each mention of an event also includes an **EventTimeDate** field, which corresponds to the **DATEADDED** timestamp of the original event. This linkage allows users to relate mentions back to the exact time the event was first recorded.
- This temporal anchoring enables the tracking of how events are discussed over time, including mentions of older events in current news (e.g., anniversaries or recontextualizations), thus managing the temporal dynamics of event narratives.

### Complementing Network Structure of News Events

- The **Mentions** table records every individual mention of an event across multiple articles, capturing the trajectory and network flow of stories through the global media system.
- Each mention is linked to the original event via the **GlobalEventID** and is timestamped with both the event’s original **DATEADDED** (via **EventTimeDate**) and the mention’s own timestamp (**MentionTimeDate**).
- This structure allows for constructing a network of how an event propagates through different media sources over time, showing the diffusion and evolution of news coverage.
- The **DATEADDED** field ensures that the temporal origin of the event is clearly established, which is essential for understanding the sequence and timing of mentions, and for distinguishing between first reports and subsequent references.
- Together, the **DATEADDED** field and the Mentions table enable filtering and prioritizing mentions based on their timing relative to the event’s occurrence, as well as their confidence and prominence, thus supporting nuanced analyses of event salience and media attention dynamics.

### Summary

- **DATEADDED** provides a precise temporal anchor for each event, enabling queries at 15-minute resolution and establishing the event’s initial appearance in the database.
- The **Mentions** table builds on this by recording every instance an event is mentioned, regardless of when the mention occurs, thus capturing the temporal spread and network structure of news coverage.
- This combination allows researchers and analysts to manage both the temporal resolution of events and the complex network of their mentions, facilitating detailed tracking of how events emerge, evolve, and persist in the global media landscape.","The DATEADDED field in event sourcing stores the date and time an event was added to the master database in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format in UTC timezone, allowing queries at a 15-minute resolution to access events precisely. This temporal granularity complements the Mentions table in GDELT 2.0, which records each individual mention of events from the Event table, enabling detailed event tracking by capturing the trajectory and network structure of stories as they flow through global media. While the DATEADDED field provides exact timing for when events enter the database, the Mentions table tracks mentions irrespective of the original event date, including mentions of historical or anniversary events, thus allowing comprehensive temporal and contextual analysis of event dissemination and media coverage.",0.9423076923076923,0.9661086916348779,0.9999999999666667,1.0
"What limitations did the previous GKG system have in associating contextual details, and how do the unique record identifiers introduced in GKG 2.1 improve the management and referencing of GKG records?","['of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html'
 '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,'
 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.

 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but'

This lack of association made it difficult to understand the relationships and context between these data points within the article.

GKG 2.1 improves this by introducing the approximate character offset of each reference to an object in the original article. Although this does not provide deep semantic associations, it enables simple proximity-based contextualization. For instance, mentions of the United States are likely to be closer in the text to Barack Obama and John Kerry than to Vladimir Putin, and the role ""Secretary of State"" is likely closer to John Kerry. This proximity information allows users to infer functional, thematic, and geographic affiliations more effectively.

Additionally, GKG 2.1 introduces unique record identifiers (GKGRECORDID) for each GKG record. These identifiers are globally unique strings that encode the date and time of the update batch and a sequential number within that batch (e.g., ""20150203033000-5""). Records from translated documents include a ""T"" to distinguish them (e.g., ""20150203033000-T5""). These unique identifiers improve the management and referencing of GKG records by allowing users to unambiguously refer to a specific record across the entire GKG database. This aligns the GKG system with the practices of the GDELT Event Database and facilitates easier filtering, tracking, and integration of records.

In summary:

- **Limitations of previous GKG system:**  
  - Could not associate people, locations, and roles within an article.  
  - Only recorded co-occurrence without linking entities contextually.

- **Improvements with GKG 2.1:**  
  - Provides approximate character offsets for each reference, enabling proximity-based contextualization.  
  - Introduces unique record identifiers (GKGRECORDID) that uniquely identify each record, improving referencing and management.","The previous GKG system had difficulty associating various data points together, such as linking people, organizations, locations, and their functional roles within the same article.

How does the GDELT system use sentiment analysis and date mentions to identify anniversary violence indicators?,"['adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening \nentirely new analytic opportunities.  Some of the most significant changes: \n \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes.  The GDELT Global Content Analysis \nMeasures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment \nanalysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together \nassess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual \ndimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, \nFrench, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and \nUrdu).  GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents \nand reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from \nLIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Translation of 65 Languages.  GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n\uf0b7 \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.  A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now \nspecify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that \nrepresents the core focus of the article.  GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.  This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations \nanywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act \nas a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \n\uf0b7 \nQuotes, Names, and Amounts.  The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food \nprices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable \nitem.  GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to \noffer numeric context to global events.  In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing \nPerson and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, \nsuch as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World \nCup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran \nNuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n\uf0b7 \nDate Mentions.  We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references \nfound in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates \nas possible “anniversary violence” indicators.  All day, month, and year dates are now extracted \nfrom each document. \n\uf0b7 \nProximity Context.  Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the \nintroduction of the new Proximity Context capability.  The GKG records an enormously rich array'
 'Finally, a set of fields at the end of the record provide additional data management information for the \nevent record.   \n \n\uf0b7 \nDATEADDED. (integer) This field stores the date the event was added to the master database \nin YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format in the UTC timezone.  For those needing to access events at 15 \nminute resolution, this is the field that should be used in queries. \n\uf0b7 \nSOURCEURL.  (string) This field records the URL or citation of the first news report it found this \nevent in.  In most cases this is the first report it saw the article in, but due to the timing and \nflow of news reports through the processing pipeline, this may not always be the very first \nreport, but is at least in the first few reports. \n \n \n \nMENTIONS TABLE \n \nThe Mentions table is a new addition to GDELT 2.0 and records each mention of the events in the Event \ntable, making it possible to track the trajectory and network structure of a story as it flows through the \nglobal media system.  Each mention of an event receives its own entry in the Mentions table – thus an \nevent which is mentioned in 100 articles will be listed 100 times in the Mentions table.  Mentions are \nrecorded irrespective of the date of the original event, meaning that a mention today of an event from a \nyear ago will still be recorded, making it possible to trace discussion of “anniversary events” or historical \nevents being recontextualized into present actions.  If a news report mentions multiple events, each \nmention is recorded separately in this table.  For translated documents, all measures below are based \non its English translation. \n \nSeveral of the new measures recorded in the Mentions table make it possible to better filter events \nbased on how confident GDELT was in its extraction of that event.  When trying to understand news \nmedia spanning the entire globe, one finds that journalism is rife with ambiguities, assumed background \nknowledge, and complex linguistic structures.  Not every event mention will take the form of “American \nPresident Barack Obama met with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday at a trade summit in Paris, \nFrance.”  Instead, an event mention might more commonly appear as “Obama and Putin were in Paris \nyesterday for a trade summit.  The two leaders met backstage where he discussed his policy on \nUkraine.”  To which of the two leader(s) do “he” and “his” refer?  Is Obama discussing Obama’s policy on \nUkraine, or is Obama discussing Putin’s policy on Ukraine, or is it Putin discussing Putin’s policy or \nperhaps Putin discussing Obama’s policy?  While additional cues may be available in the surrounding \ntext, ambiguous event mentions like this are exceptionally common across the world’s media.  Similarly, \nit would be difficult indeed to maintain an exhaustive list of every single political figure in the entire \nworld and thus context is often critical for disambiguating the geographic affiliation of an actor.  Even in \nthe case of more senior political leadership, a reference to “Renauld’s press conference this afternoon in \nPort-au-Prince” most likely refers to Lener Renauld, the Minister of Defense of Haiti, but this \ndisambiguation still carries with it some degree of ambiguity.  GDELT makes use of an array of natural \nlanguage processing algorithms like coreference and deep parsing using whole-of-document context.  \nWhile these enormously increase GDELT’s ability to understand and extract ambiguous and linguistically \ncomplex events, such extractions also come with a higher potential for error.  Under GDELT 1.0, the \nNumMentions field as designed as a composite score of the absolute number of unique documents \nmentioning an event and the number of revisions to the text required by these various algorithms, up to \nsix revision passes.  Under GDELT 2.0, the Mentions table now separates these, with each record in the \nMentions table recording an individual mention of an event in an article, while the new Confidence field'

 'THE GDELT EVENT DATABASE \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.0 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their \ndescriptions.  GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, \ncapturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2.  A wide array of variables break \nout the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, \nthe Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique \narray of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both \nactors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the \nstory of each event “in flight” through the global media system. \n \nAt present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, \nhowever in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 \nformat.  The   Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note \nthat files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited).   \n \nWith the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at \nleast through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without \nmodification.  Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning \nFebruary 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches \nback to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. \n  \nThere are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset.  The first is the \ntraditional Event table.  This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several \nchanges as noted below.  In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records \nall mentions of each event.  As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those \nmentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, \nincluding the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus \nbeing buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event \nfrom that specific news report.  The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it \npossible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases.  Those wishing to find the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of \nperiod “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest \nevents with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the \nhighest Confidence measures.  This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each \nindividual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below).  It also makes it possible to \nidentify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those \nwith the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific \nsource language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).'
 'records GDELT’s confidence in its extraction of that event from that particular article.  This field is a \npercent, ranging from 10 to 100% and indicates how aggressively GDELT had to perform tasks like \ncoreference or grammatical restructuring to extract the event from that article.  Sorting all mentions of \nan event by this field makes it possible to identify articles featuring the strongest and most \nunambiguous discussion of an event. \n \n\uf0b7 \nGlobalEventID.  (integer)  This is the ID of the event that was mentioned in the article. \n\uf0b7 \nEventTimeDate.  (integer)  This is the 15-minute timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) when the \nevent being mentioned was first recorded by GDELT (the DATEADDED field of the original event \nrecord).  This field can be compared against the next one to identify events being mentioned for \nthe first time (their first mentions) or to identify events of a particular vintage being mentioned \nnow (such as filtering for mentions of events at least one week old). \n\uf0b7 \nMentionTimeDate.  (integer)  This is the 15-minute timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) of the \ncurrent update.  This is identical for all entries in the update file but is included to make it easier \nto load the Mentions table into a database.   \n\uf0b7 \nMentionType.  (integer)  This is a numeric identifier that refers to the source collection the \ndocument came from and is used to interpret the MentionIdentifier in the next column.  In \nessence, it specifies how to interpret the MentionIdentifier to locate the actual document.  At \npresent, it can hold one of the following values: \no 1 = WEB (The document originates from the open web and the MentionIdentifier is a \nfully-qualified URL that can be used to access the document on the web). \no 2 = CITATIONONLY (The document originates from a broadcast, print, or other offline \nsource in which only a textual citation is available for the document.  In this case the \nMentionIdentifier contains the textual citation for the document). \no 3 = CORE (The document originates from the CORE archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through the CORE \nwebsite). \no 4 = DTIC (The document originates from the DTIC archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through the DTIC website). \no 5 = JSTOR (The document originates from the JSTOR archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through your JSTOR \nsubscription if your institution subscribes to it). \no 6 = NONTEXTUALSOURCE (The document originates from a textual proxy (such as closed \ncaptioning) of a non-textual information source (such as a video) available via a URL and \nthe MentionIdentifier provides the URL of the non-textual original source.  At present, \nthis Collection Identifier is used for processing of the closed captioning streams of the \nInternet Archive Television News Archive in which each broadcast is available via a URL, \nbut the URL offers access only to the video of the broadcast and does not provide any \naccess to the textual closed captioning used to generate the metadata.  This code is \nused in order to draw a distinction between URL-based textual material (Collection \nIdentifier 1 (WEB) and URL-based non-textual material like the Television News Archive). \n\uf0b7 \nMentionSourceName.  (integer)  This is a human-friendly identifier of the source of the \ndocument.  For material originating from the open web with a URL this field will contain the top-\nlevel domain the page was from.  For BBC Monitoring material it will contain “BBC Monitoring” \nand for JSTOR material it will contain “JSTOR.”  This field is intended for human display of major \nsources as well as for network analysis of information flows by source, obviating the \nrequirement to perform domain or other parsing of the MentionIdentifier field.']","['<1-hop>\n\nadds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening entirely new analytic opportunities.

Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the introduction of the new Proximity Context capability. The GKG records an enormously rich array']","The GDELT system uses sentiment analysis and date mentions to identify anniversary violence indicators through the following mechanisms:

1. **Sentiment Analysis via GCAM Module**:  
   - GDELT's Global Content Analysis Measures (GCAM) module performs real-time sentiment analysis on every news article it processes.  
   - It assesses over 2,300 emotions and themes using 24 different emotional measurement packages, covering a wide range of emotional dimensions such as anxiety, positivity, smugness, and passivity.  
   - This multilingual sentiment analysis (covering 15 languages natively and translating 65 languages into English) enables GDELT to capture the emotional undercurrents and reactions in news reports globally.  
   - By analyzing the emotional tone and themes in articles mentioning specific events, GDELT can detect heightened emotional responses that may signal potential violence or unrest.

2. **Extraction and Tracking of Date Mentions**:  
   - GDELT extracts all day, month, and year date references from news articles and documents.  
   - This allows the system to identify repeated mentions of specific dates, which can be indicative of anniversaries of past events.  
   - The Mentions table records every mention of an event, regardless of when the original event occurred. This means that if an event from a previous year is mentioned again (e.g., on its anniversary), that mention is captured and timestamped.  
   - By comparing the event's original date with the current mention date, GDELT can detect when anniversaries are being referenced in the media.

3. **Combining Sentiment and Date Mentions to Identify Anniversary Violence Indicators**:  
   - When news articles mention specific past dates repeatedly (anniversaries) and simultaneously exhibit strong negative or violent emotional tones (as detected by GCAM), these can serve as indicators of potential anniversary violence.  
   - The system’s ability to track the trajectory and network of event mentions over time, along with confidence scores and proximity context, helps filter and identify significant anniversary-related violence signals from the global media flow.

In summary, GDELT leverages its advanced, multilingual sentiment analysis to gauge emotional intensity and themes in news coverage, while its extraction of date mentions enables it to detect repeated references to specific dates. Together, these capabilities allow GDELT to identify and monitor indicators of anniversary violence by spotting emotionally charged mentions of past violent events on or near their anniversaries.","The GDELT system employs an extensive sentiment analysis capability through its Global Content Analysis Measures (GCAM) module, which measures over 2,300 emotions and themes in real time across multiple languages. This allows for unparalleled assessment of emotional undercurrents in global news. Additionally, GDELT extracts all day, month, and year date mentions from news articles and documents to identify repeating references to specific dates, which can serve as possible ""anniversary violence"" indicators. By combining these capabilities, GDELT can analyze emotional trends alongside temporal patterns to detect potential indicators of anniversary-related violence.",0.7575757575757576,0.9680550007884033,0.9999999999,0.75

As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those \nmentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, \nincluding the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus \nbeing buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event \nfrom that specific news report.  The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it \npossible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases.  Those wishing to find the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of \nperiod “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest \nevents with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the \nhighest Confidence measures.  This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each \nindividual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below).  It also makes it possible to \nidentify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those \nwith the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific \nsource language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).'
 'of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html'
 '2\nConstructing a Knowledge Graph for GDELT\nAs previously mentioned, while the GDELT-GKG2 dataset is not actually natively in the form of a knowledge\ngraph, it is advertised and frequently cited as being one. We believe that we are making a distinct contribution\nto the research community by converting the very popular GKG2 database into a proper KG.\nGKG2 is natively a database of three related tables:\n• expert.csv captures event information;\n• GKG.csv captures article information; and\n• mentions.csv relates which articles mention which events.\nFigure 2: GDELT GKG 2.0 schema relating articles (GKG), mentions, and events (Export).\nThe database schema for these three CSV files is shown in Fig. 2 (see also [9]). The key characteristics of\nthis database relational schema should be interpreted as follows:\n• The three tables are color-coded by Events (green), Mentions (pink), and Articles (blue).\n• The single table of Events is shown in multiple green sub-tables, simply for clarity and convenience to\nlayout a long record structure.\n• Single-headed arrows represent one-to-many relationships between the tables. Specifically:\n– Each Event maps to multiple Mentions via the shared GLOBALEVENTID field.\n– Each Article maps to multiple Mentions via the DocumentIdentifer field on the Article side\nmatching to the MentionIdentifier field on the Mention side.\n• In this way, the Mentions table acts as a “pairs file” recording a many-many relation between Events\nand Articles: each event can be mentioned in multiple articles, and dually each article can men-\ntion many events. Each Article also has both a unique identifier through the GKGRECORDID or the\nDocumentIdentifer fields, since each row in the GKG data represents a single article.\n3'
 'Figure 3: GDELT GKG 2.0 ontology relating articles and events..\nMethods to automatically determine the graphical form of a relational database are widely known [21]. Most\nnaturally, consider a table T with m rows T[j], 1 ≤j ≤m and n columns T.i, 1 ≤i ≤n. Then each of the\nm rows T[j] is represented as a node in one meta-class labeled by the primary keys. This node then has n\noutgoing edges, each connecting to a node in another meta-class representing the field value T[j].i, and labeled\nby the column name. The resulting “star” bipartite graphs are then linked over shared values, including\nacross multiple tables. This method straightforwardly produces a graph schema consistent with a given\nRDB, which may or may not be of sufficient complexity to warrant the lofty description of “ontology”. In\nour case, such a straightforward approach is mostly warranted, although as we will see additional constraints\nin the event table will argue for a somewhat more specific and idosyncratic graph structure.\nAfter understanding the GDELT database schema, we developed a capability to convert (portions of) the\nGDELT database to a KG using an ontology as a graph typing schema, derived from the above relational\nschema. This is shown in Fig. 3, to be interpreted as follows:\n• Nodes in the ontology indicate the types of nodes possible in the KG.\n• Nodes are color-coded to indicate their source relational table.\n• Fields in ⟨angled brackets⟩indicate the field name in the schema.\n4'
 'EVENT TABLE \n \nEVENTID AND DATE ATTRIBUTES \n \nThe first few fields of an event record capture its globally unique identifier number, the date the event \ntook place on, and several alternatively formatted versions of the date designed to make it easier to \nwork with the event records in different analytical software programs that may have specific date \nformat requirements.  The parenthetical after each variable name gives the datatype of that field. \n \nNote that even though GDELT 2.0 operates at a 15 minute resolution, the date fields in this section still \nrecord the date at the daily level, since this is the resolution that event analysis has historically been \nperformed at.  To examine events at the 15 minute resolution, use the DATEADDED field (the second \nfrom the last field in this table at the end).  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGlobalEventID.  (integer) Globally unique identifier assigned to each event record that uniquely \nidentifies it in the master dataset.  NOTE: While these will often be sequential with date, this is \nNOT always the case and this field should NOT be used to sort events by date: the date fields \nshould be used for this.  NOTE: There is a large gap in the sequence between February 18, 2015 \nand February 19, 2015 with the switchover to GDELT 2.0 – these are not missing events, the ID \nsequence was simply reset at a higher number so that it is possible to easily distinguish events \ncreated after the switchover to GDELT 2.0 from those created using the older GDELT 1.0 system. \n\uf0b7 \nDay.  (integer) Date the event took place in YYYYMMDD format.  See DATEADDED field for \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS date. \n\uf0b7 \nMonthYear.  (integer) Alternative formatting of the event date, in YYYYMM format. \n\uf0b7 \nYear.  (integer) Alternative formatting of the event date, in YYYY format. \n\uf0b7 \nFractionDate.  (floating point) Alternative formatting of the event date, computed as YYYY.FFFF, \nwhere FFFF is the percentage of the year completed by that day.  This collapses the month and \nday into a fractional range from 0 to 0.9999, capturing the 365 days of the year.  The fractional \ncomponent (FFFF) is computed as (MONTH * 30 + DAY) / 365.  This is an approximation and does \nnot correctly take into account the differing numbers of days in each month or leap years, but \noffers a simple single-number sorting mechanism for applications that wish to estimate the \nrough temporal distance between dates. \n \n \nACTOR ATTRIBUTES \n \nThe next fields describe attributes and characteristics of the two actors involved in the event.  This \nincludes the complete raw CAMEO code for each actor, its proper name, and associated attributes.  The \nraw CAMEO code for each actor contains an array of coded attributes indicating geographic, ethnic, and \nreligious affiliation and the actor’s role in the environment (political elite, military officer, rebel, etc).  \nThese 3-character codes may be combined in any order and are concatenated together to form the final \nraw actor CAMEO code.  To make it easier to utilize this information in analysis, this section breaks these \ncodes out into a set of individual fields that can be separately queried.

GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, capturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2. A wide array of variables break out the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, the Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique array of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both actors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the story of each event “in flight” through the global media system. At present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, however in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 format. The Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note that files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited). With the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at least through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without modification. Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning February 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches back to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. There are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset. The first is the traditional Event table. This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several changes as noted below. In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records all mentions of each event. As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those mentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, including the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus being buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event from that specific news report. The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it possible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases. Those wishing to find the earliest glimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of period “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest events with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the highest Confidence measures. This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each individual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below). It also makes it possible to identify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those with the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific source language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).'

This format captures two actors involved in an event—Actor1 and Actor2—and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2. The event records include a wide array of variables that break out the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields, making it easier to interact with the data. Specifically:

- The **raw CAMEO actor codes** for each actor contain coded attributes indicating geographic, ethnic, religious affiliations, and the actor’s role (e.g., political elite, military officer, rebel).
- These codes are concatenated 3-character codes that are expanded into individual fields for easier querying.
- The **action codes** are also broken out into their hierarchical components.
- Additional fields include the **Goldstein ranking score** (which quantifies the event’s impact), and a unique set of **georeferencing fields** that provide estimated geographic positioning at the landmark-centroid level for both actors and the event location.
- The event records are stored one per line, tab-delimited, with fields capturing event identifiers, dates (in multiple formats), actor attributes, and event details.

Regarding the **introduction of unique record identifiers in the GKG (Global Knowledge Graph)**, this aligns with the GDELT Event Database’s practice of assigning a **globally unique identifier (GlobalEventID)** to each event record. The key points are:

- Each GDELT event record has a **GlobalEventID**, a unique integer that identifies the event across the entire dataset. Although these IDs may often be sequential with date, they should not be used to sort events chronologically.
- Similarly, every GKG record is now assigned a **unique identifier** (e.g., GKGRECORDID or DocumentIdentifier for articles), which uniquely identifies each record in the GKG dataset.
- This practice of unique identifiers in both datasets facilitates **advanced data referencing and analysis** by allowing precise linking and cross-referencing of records.
- For example, the GKG’s unique identifiers enable linking articles to events via the Mentions table, which records many-to-many relationships between events and articles.
- The unique IDs allow users to **uniquely refer to specific records**, filter data effectively, and integrate data across the Event and GKG datasets, supporting complex queries and dynamic filtering based on confidence scores, mention prominence, and other metadata.

In summary, the GDELT Event Database’s expanded dyadic CAMEO format structures events by detailing two actors and their interaction with rich coded attributes and hierarchical action codes, while the introduction of unique record identifiers in the GKG mirrors the Event Database’s approach, enabling robust, precise referencing and integration across datasets for enhanced analytical capabilities.","The GDELT Event Database structures its event records using an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, which captures two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2.

 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but'
 '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.

 'THE GDELT EVENT DATABASE \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.0 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their \ndescriptions.  GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, \ncapturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2.  A wide array of variables break \nout the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, \nthe Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique \narray of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both \nactors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the \nstory of each event “in flight” through the global media system. \n \nAt present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, \nhowever in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 \nformat.  The   Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note \nthat files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited).   \n \nWith the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at \nleast through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without \nmodification.  Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning \nFebruary 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches \nback to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. \n  \nThere are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset.  The first is the \ntraditional Event table.  This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several \nchanges as noted below.  In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records \nall mentions of each event.  As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those \nmentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, \nincluding the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus \nbeing buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event \nfrom that specific news report.  The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it \npossible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases.  Those wishing to find the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of \nperiod “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest \nevents with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the \nhighest Confidence measures.  This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each \nindividual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below).  It also makes it possible to \nidentify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those \nwith the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific \nsource language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).']","['<1-hop>\n\n\uf0b7 Single Data File. Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only and one containing the full GKG file. The original rationale for having two separate files was that users interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly all applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to contextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database. Thus, we are eliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \uf0b7 Production Status.

 '<2-hop>\n\nUnique Record Identifiers. To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event Database, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier. As with the event database, sequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a record across the entire collection. The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will make it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. 1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html']","The introduction of unique record identifiers in the GKG aligns with the practices of the GDELT Event Database by adopting a similar approach where each record is assigned a unique identifier that distinctly identifies it across the entire collection. In the GDELT Event Database, unique identifiers are used to track individual events and their mentions, enabling precise referencing and relational mapping. By bringing the GKG in line with this practice, each GKG record (which corresponds to an article) now has a unique identifier, facilitating easier and unambiguous referencing of specific records.

This alignment simplifies the GKG data environment in several ways:

1. **Unique Reference:** With unique record identifiers, users can uniquely refer to and retrieve specific GKG records without confusion or ambiguity, improving data management and integration.

2. **Consistency Across Datasets:** It harmonizes the GKG with the Event Database’s structure, making it easier to link and cross-reference data between the two datasets, which is important since GKG records relate to articles and the Event Database records events mentioned in those articles.

3. **Simplification of Data Handling:** Previously, the GKG had two separate files (one for counts only and one for full data), but the introduction of unique identifiers and other structural improvements have allowed the elimination of the counts-only file, consolidating data into a single file. This reduces complexity for users and streamlines data processing workflows.

4. **Improved Data Provenance and Tracking:** Unique identifiers help track the provenance of metadata at the document level, which is critical given the GKG’s move away from clustering articles with identical metadata (as was done in earlier versions) to treating each article as a separate record.

In summary, the adoption of unique record identifiers in the GKG mirrors the Event Database’s approach, enabling precise, consistent, and simplified referencing of records. This change, along with the consolidation of data files, significantly simplifies the GKG data environment by making it easier to manage, link, and analyze the data.","The introduction of unique record identifiers in the GKG aligns with the practices of the GDELT Event Database by assigning every GKG record a unique identifier, which uniquely identifies a record across the entire collection, similar to the event database. This change facilitates easier and more precise referencing of particular GKG records. Additionally, the GKG data environment is simplified by eliminating the separate counts-only file, consolidating data into a single full GKG file that includes thematic and other data fields to contextualize counts and tie them into the GDELT Event Database. Together, these changes improve data management and usability within the GDELT Event Database framework.",0.8,0.9496672328794604,0.499999999975,0.75
"How does the introduction of the Proximity Context capability in GKG Version 2.1 improve upon the features available in version 1.0, particularly in relation to encoding date mentions and maintaining backwards compatibility?","['\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.

An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,'
 'adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening \nentirely new analytic opportunities.  Some of the most significant changes: \n \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes.  The GDELT Global Content Analysis \nMeasures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment \nanalysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together \nassess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual \ndimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, \nFrench, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and \nUrdu).  GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents \nand reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from \nLIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Translation of 65 Languages.  GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n\uf0b7 \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.  A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now \nspecify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that \nrepresents the core focus of the article.  GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.  This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations \nanywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act \nas a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \n\uf0b7 \nQuotes, Names, and Amounts.  The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food \nprices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable \nitem.  GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to \noffer numeric context to global events.  In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing \nPerson and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, \nsuch as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World \nCup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran \nNuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n\uf0b7 \nDate Mentions.  We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references \nfound in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates \nas possible “anniversary violence” indicators.  All day, month, and year dates are now extracted \nfrom each document. \n\uf0b7 \nProximity Context.  Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the \nintroduction of the new Proximity Context capability.  The GKG records an enormously rich array'
 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.'
 'of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html'

It applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to compute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document. To sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening around the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every single day. It has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system on November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an incredible number and diversity of fields. The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent dimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly unimaginable new applications. We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and capabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we are both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original alpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. Due to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create a raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of software packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely complex analytic needs in a single file.

1. **Enhanced Contextual Association of Entities**:  
   - In GKG 1.0, while the system recorded people, organizations, locations, and events mentioned in an article, it did not provide a way to associate these entities with each other within the text. For example, it could list Barack Obama, John Kerry, Vladimir Putin, the United States, and Russia as mentioned in the same article, but it could not specify which person was linked to which location or role.
   - GKG 2.1 introduces the Proximity Context capability by providing the approximate character offset of each reference to an object in the original article. This allows users to infer proximity-based relationships, such as which person is mentioned near which location or role, enabling a more nuanced understanding of the connections between entities in the text.

2. **Improved Encoding of Date Mentions**:  
   - GKG 2.1 adds the extraction and encoding of all day, month, and year date mentions found in news articles. This was not available in Version 1.0. This enhancement allows for identifying patterns such as repeated mentions of specific dates, which can be useful for detecting phenomena like “anniversary violence” or other date-related trends.

3. **Backwards Compatibility and Transition**:  
   - While GKG 2.1 introduces these new capabilities and changes, it preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format to maintain backwards compatibility.
   - The GKG 1.0 format files will continue to be generated in parallel for the foreseeable future, allowing users to continue using the older format if needed.
   - However, GKG 2.0 was only used for special subcollections and is not supported for daily news content; only GKG 1.0 and 2.1 formats are supported for news content.
   - Code designed for GKG 2.0 can be adapted to GKG 2.1 with minimal modification, indicating a smooth transition path.

In summary, the Proximity Context capability in GKG 2.1 enables a richer, more precise contextualization of entities within articles by encoding their relative positions, which was not possible in Version 1.0. Additionally, the encoding of date mentions adds a new dimension of temporal analysis. These improvements are integrated while maintaining backwards compatibility with GKG 1.0, facilitating user transition and continued use of existing workflows.","The introduction of the Proximity Context capability in GKG Version 2.1 represents the greatest change from version 1.0, enhancing the overall format by providing a richer array of contextual information. While version 1.0 focused on encoding date mentions such as all day, month, and year dates extracted from documents to identify repeating mentions like ""anniversary violence"" indicators, Version 2.1 expands the system's ability to capture latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of global news through sophisticated natural language processing algorithms. Importantly, Version 2.1 preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format to ensure backwards compatibility, and the system continues to generate daily Version 1.0 files in parallel, allowing users to transition smoothly while benefiting from the new features like Proximity Context.",1.0,0.9614935060155445,0.6791666666496875,1.0
how GCAM with its realtime measurement of 2300 emotions and themes and realtime translation of 65 languages changed the way GKG 2.1 format handle article clustering and inclusion criteria compared to GKG 1.0 and 2.0,"['\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,'
 'adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening \nentirely new analytic opportunities.  Some of the most significant changes: \n \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes.  The GDELT Global Content Analysis \nMeasures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment \nanalysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together \nassess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual \ndimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, \nFrench, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and \nUrdu).  GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents \nand reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from \nLIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Translation of 65 Languages.  GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n\uf0b7 \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.  A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now \nspecify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that \nrepresents the core focus of the article.  GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.  This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations \nanywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act \nas a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \n\uf0b7 \nQuotes, Names, and Amounts.  The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food \nprices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable \nitem.  GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to \noffer numeric context to global events.  In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing \nPerson and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, \nsuch as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World \nCup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran \nNuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n\uf0b7 \nDate Mentions.  We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references \nfound in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates \nas possible “anniversary violence” indicators.  All day, month, and year dates are now extracted \nfrom each document. \n\uf0b7 \nProximity Context.  Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the \nintroduction of the new Proximity Context capability.  The GKG records an enormously rich array'
 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but'
 'of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html'
 '2\nConstructing a Knowledge Graph for GDELT\nAs previously mentioned, while the GDELT-GKG2 dataset is not actually natively in the form of a knowledge\ngraph, it is advertised and frequently cited as being one. We believe that we are making a distinct contribution\nto the research community by converting the very popular GKG2 database into a proper KG.\nGKG2 is natively a database of three related tables:\n• expert.csv captures event information;\n• GKG.csv captures article information; and\n• mentions.csv relates which articles mention which events.\nFigure 2: GDELT GKG 2.0 schema relating articles (GKG), mentions, and events (Export).\nThe database schema for these three CSV files is shown in Fig. 2 (see also [9]). The key characteristics of\nthis database relational schema should be interpreted as follows:\n• The three tables are color-coded by Events (green), Mentions (pink), and Articles (blue).\n• The single table of Events is shown in multiple green sub-tables, simply for clarity and convenience to\nlayout a long record structure.\n• Single-headed arrows represent one-to-many relationships between the tables. Specifically:\n– Each Event maps to multiple Mentions via the shared GLOBALEVENTID field.\n– Each Article maps to multiple Mentions via the DocumentIdentifer field on the Article side\nmatching to the MentionIdentifier field on the Mention side.\n• In this way, the Mentions table acts as a “pairs file” recording a many-many relation between Events\nand Articles: each event can be mentioned in multiple articles, and dually each article can men-\ntion many events. Each Article also has both a unique identifier through the GKGRECORDID or the\nDocumentIdentifer fields, since each row in the GKG data represents a single article.\n3']","['<1-hop>\n\nadds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening entirely new analytic opportunities.

 '<2-hop>\n\nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 The GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were released in that format. With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has remained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of significant enhancements to the GKG system. While it was originally intended to release these new features in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these fields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and the need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical representation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to accommodate these goals. Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to the GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification. Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of special subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 compatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be supported for news content. From a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 revolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the GKG stream. Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event stream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG metadata. Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would be grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2. With the introduction of the new GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear that the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, themes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very different GCAM scores. In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture necessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level. Thus, GKG 2.1 no longer clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of extracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the GKG stream. The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering. In addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article to appear in the GKG. Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output. However, many topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy discussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a single location. This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of high relevance to many GDELT user communities. Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in the GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional scores. An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,']","The introduction of GCAM with its realtime measurement of over 2,300 emotions and themes, along with realtime translation of 65 languages, fundamentally changed how the GKG 2.1 format handles article clustering and inclusion criteria compared to GKG 1.0 and 2.0 in the following ways:

1. **Article Clustering:**
   - **GKG 1.0:** Articles were clustered together if they shared the same metadata (locations, themes, people, organizations). For example, two articles with identical metadata would be grouped into a single row with a count of 2.
   - **GKG 2.1:** Due to GCAM’s detailed emotional and thematic analysis, multiple articles with the same locations, themes, people, and organizations might have very different GCAM scores because they use different language and emotional content. Therefore, GKG 2.1 no longer clusters articles based on shared metadata. Instead, each article appears as a separate entry, even if they share the same metadata. This change allows the system to preserve the unique emotional and thematic nuances of each article.
   - **GKG 2.0:** Was largely similar to 2.1 in format but was only used for special subcollections and did not handle daily news content; clustering was still performed in 1.0 style for daily news.

2. **Inclusion Criteria:**
   - **GKG 1.0 and 2.0:** An article had to contain at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location to be included in the GKG stream.
   - **GKG 2.1:** With GCAM’s ability to extract emotional scores and themes, the inclusion criteria were broadened. Now, an article is included if it contains *any* successfully extracted information, including GCAM emotional scores, even if it has no geographic mentions. This change allows inclusion of articles on topics without strong geographic focus (e.g., cybersecurity, constitutional discourse), which were previously excluded.

3. **Provenance and Metadata Identification:**
   - The realtime translation of 65 languages necessitated the ability to identify metadata provenance at the document level, reinforcing the need to treat each article as a unique record rather than clustering.

In summary, GCAM’s realtime emotional and thematic measurement and the realtime translation capability led to GKG 2.1 treating each article as a unique entry without clustering by shared metadata, and expanded the inclusion criteria to accept articles without geographic mentions but with emotional or thematic content. This represents a significant shift from GKG 1.0 and 2.0, enabling richer, more nuanced, and more inclusive data representation in the GKG.","The GCAM module, which provides realtime measurement of more than 2,300 emotions and themes across multiple languages, along with realtime translation of 65 languages, significantly impacted the GKG system's handling of articles in the GKG 2.1 format. Unlike the GKG 1.0 format, which clustered articles together based on shared metadata such as locations, themes, people, and organizations, the introduction of GCAM revealed that articles with identical metadata could have very different emotional and thematic scores. Therefore, GKG 2.1 no longer clusters documents with the same metadata but treats each article as a separate entry to preserve the distinct GCAM emotional assessments. Additionally, the realtime translation capability enabled identification of metadata provenance at the document level, further supporting this change. Moreover, the inclusion criteria for articles in GKG 2.1 were relaxed compared to GKG 1.0 and 2.0; previously, articles needed at least one geocoded geographic location to be included, but with GCAM's emotional scoring, articles without geographic mentions but containing emotional data are now included, broadening the scope of content captured by the GKG system.",0.9772727272727273,0.9108847913161865,0.99999999995,1.0
