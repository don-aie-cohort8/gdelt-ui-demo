How does the ontology-based framework developed for constructing knowledge graphs from the GDELT dataset improve question-answering capabilities compared to traditional text-based Retrieval Augmented Generation approaches?,"['Abstract In this work we study various Retrieval Augmented Regeneration (RAG) approaches to gain an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in a question-answering analysis. To gain this understanding we use a case-study subset of the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) dataset as well as a corpus of raw text scraped from the online news articles. To retrieve information from the text corpus we implement a traditional vector store RAG as well as state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) based approaches for automatically constructing KGs and retrieving the relevant subgraphs. In addition to these corpus approaches, we develop a novel ontology-based framework for constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from GDELT directly which leverages the underlying schema of GDELT to create structured representations of global events. For retrieving relevant information from the ontology-based KGs we implement both direct graph queries and state-of-the-art graph retrieval approaches. We compare the performance of each method in a question-answering task. We find that while our ontology-based KGs are valuable for question-answering, automated extraction of the relevant subgraphs is challenging. Conversely, LLM-generated KGs, while capturing event summaries, often lack consistency and interpretability. Our findings suggest benefits of a synergistic approach between ontology and LLM-based KG construction, with proposed avenues toward that end. 1 Introduction In this work we study several approaches for communicating with a corpus of text via relevant text and knowledge graph (KG) representation and retrieval facilitated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our goal is to understand the benefits and drawbacks of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches to corpus management and anlysis when combined with an LLM. Throughout we use as a case study a novel KG derived from the Global Data on Events, Location, and Tone (GDELT)1 [13] dataset. As a way to enhance LLM outputs, researchers and practitioners have been quick in applying LLMs to query and understand proprietary data through retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) [14]. It has been shown that reasoning over the typical RAG framework, which only takes advantage of the unstructured text articles, fails to capture global information about the provided data [5, 27]. Motivated by this limitation, there has been recent interest in adapting these techniques to the case where our data has a graph structure, so that the LLM can directly ingest important relationships in the knowledge base [5, 7, 15, 31]. More specifically, KGs [8] are graph structures which are richly attributed with typing and semantic information on both nodes and edges. KG techniques provide ways to automatically query and extract information stored in a KG without the user explicitly needing to understand query languages to probe their knowledge base. Typically, these AI-based search algorithms find subgraphs that can be used to answer a user-provided query. The interactions between KGs and LLMs have potential beyond merely question-answering and knowledge extraction (see different research directions outlined by Pan et al. [18]). In particular, reflective of KGs being used to enhance LLM outputs, LLMs can be used to enhance existing KGs or create new ones entirely from scratch. However, exploration of techniques to this end either (1) do not deal with imposing different ontological structures in graph creation or (2) only focus on extracting ontological structures using LLMs 1https://www.gdeltproject.org/ 1']","The ontology-based framework for constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from GDELT leverages the underlying schema of GDELT to create structured representations of global events.

Compared to traditional text-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches that rely on unstructured text, the ontology-based KGs provide valuable structured information that enhances question-answering.

Therefore, the ontology-based framework improves question-answering by offering structured, schema-driven representations of events that complement and potentially overcome limitations of purely text-based RAG methods.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer,"The ontology-based framework developed for constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from the GDELT dataset improves question-answering capabilities compared to traditional text-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches in several key ways:

1. **Structured Representation of Global Events**:  
   The ontology-based framework leverages the underlying schema of GDELT to create a richly structured KG (referred to as the Direct Knowledge Graph or DKG). This KG accurately reflects the relational and semantic structure of the original GDELT data, transforming it from a relational database format into a graph database with typed nodes and edges. This structured representation enables more precise and meaningful queries about global events.

2. **Enhanced Ability to Answer High-Level and Aggregate Questions**:  
   The ontology-based KG excels at answering high-level or aggregate questions that require understanding of the relationships and counts within the data. For example, it can accurately answer quantitative questions such as ""How many articles did CNN publish about the Baltimore bridge collapse?""—a type of question that traditional text-based RAG methods struggle with.

3. **Direct Graph Querying and Graph Retrieval**:  
   The framework supports direct graph queries and advanced graph retrieval methods (e.g., G-Retriever) that can extract relevant subgraphs from the KG based on natural language questions. This contrasts with traditional RAG approaches that rely solely on retrieving and processing unstructured text snippets, which may miss global context or relational information.

4. **Improved Consistency and Interpretability**:  
   Unlike KGs generated automatically by LLMs from raw text (which often suffer from inconsistent edge types, entity resolution issues, and hallucinations), the ontology-based KG adheres to a predefined schema, ensuring consistency and interpretability of the data. This makes the answers derived from the KG more reliable and easier to validate.

5. **Synergistic Potential with LLMs**:  
   While the ontology-based KG provides a strong structured foundation, the study finds that combining it with LLM-based methods (such as vector stores and GraphRAG) can further enhance question-answering by complementing the KG’s global context with detailed, document-specific information. This integrated approach leverages the strengths of both structured knowledge and unstructured text retrieval.

6. **Quantitative Evidence of Superior Performance**:  
   Empirical results show that methods using the ontology-based KG (direct graph queries and G-Retriever on the DKG) achieve higher semantic similarity scores to ground truth answers compared to traditional vector store RAG and LLM-generated KGs. This demonstrates the practical advantage of the ontology-based approach in generating accurate and relevant answers.

In summary, the ontology-based framework improves question-answering by providing a well-structured, semantically rich KG that supports precise querying and better handles complex, aggregate, and global questions—capabilities that traditional text-based RAG approaches lack due to their reliance on unstructured text and less consistent knowledge representations.","['arXiv:2503.07584v3  [cs.IR]  24 Jun 2025\nTalking to GDELT Through Knowledge Graphs\nAudun Myers, Max Vargas, Sinan G.

 'stores reveals that the LLM independently recognizes Brandon Scott as the mayor of Baltimore. For all\nother questions, the language model cannot answer the posed questions by itself due to the recency of the\nbridge collapse.\nTo quantitatively evaluate the quality of the answers generated by our different question-answering methods,\nwe require a set of ground truth answers for the questions posed. Table 2 presents these manually curated\nground truth answers, representing the expected correct responses for each question used in our evalua-\ntion. These ground truth answers serve as the benchmark against which the performance of each system is\nmeasured.\nQuestion\nGround Truth\nWhat is the name of the Bridge that collapsed and\nwhat river was it on?\nThe Francis Scott Key Bridge on the Patapsco River.\nWhat is the name of the ship that collided with the\nbaltimore bridge?\nThe ship was named the Dali.\nHow many articles did CNN publish about the Bal-\ntimore bridge collapse?\nCNN published 5 articles.\nOn what date did the Baltimore Bridge collapse?\nThe collapse occurred on March 26, 2024.\nWho is Brandon Scott?\nBrandon Scott is the Mayor of Baltimore.\nWho is Niki Fennoy?\nNiki Fennoy is a city police spokesman.\nWhat are the top themes present in the data?\nThemes include maritime incidents, manmade disaster, and\nwater-related topics.\nTable 2: Ground Truth Answers for the Baltimore Bridge Collapse Questions\nTo further validate our qualitative findings, Figure 5 presents a quantitative comparison of the semantic\nsimilarity of answers generated by the five different methods when querying the GDELT dataset related\nto the Baltimore bridge collapse. We compute the quality of the result by calculating cosine similarity5, a\nmeasure of the similarity between the embeddings of the predicted answer and the ground truth, with higher\nvalues indicating greater accuracy. The box plots illustrate the distribution of these similarity scores for each\nmethod: Graph Query on DKG, G-Retriever on DKG, RAG using Vector Store, G-Retriever on LKG, and\nGraphRAG Q&A on GRKG. As our qualitative analysis suggested, methods leveraging direct graph queries\non the DKG, standard RAG with a vector store, and GraphRAG Q&A on the GRKG generally exhibit the\nhighest cosine similarity scores, providing quantitative evidence for their superior performance in generating\naccurate and relevant answers compared to the G-Retriever, especially with the LKG. This visualization\nquantitatively confirms the trends observed in the qualitative evaluation presented in Table 1.\n4\nConclusion\nThis work has taken the GDELT GKG database and introduced an ontology to create a knowledge graph\nwith rich structure. We found that while the large KG produced by the GDELT-GKG2 database has rich\ninformation for question-answering, the ad hoc techniques for graph exploration deem further investigation\nfor reliable use. That said, the information stored in the KG produced here is not without flaws, and we\nexpect the example studied here to be useful for the broader synergy between KGs and LLMs as addressed\nby others [18]. While the KGs produced using LlamaIndex captured a summary of the events surrounding\nthe Baltimore bridge collapse, the quality of the resulting structure was not suitable for question-answering.\nThose techniques incorporated into the GraphRAG package did considerably better, but there is room for\nimprovement for answering global questions, resolving duplicate entities, and incorporating ontologically-\nguided relation extraction. We believe the incorporation of the ontology into the relation extraction will\nhave the benefit of allowing tools such as GraphRAG to better answer quantitative questions that only the\nontology based KG pipeline (DKG) was able to answer (e.g., the number of articles published on a topic).\nLarge language models continue to be adapted to solve problems across domains, and the case study on the\nKG built here presents much opportunity for future development. In particular, the debate around using\n5The\nsemantic\nembeddings\nused\nto\ncalculate\nthe\ncosine\nsimilarity\nwere\ngenerated\nusing\nthe\nsentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from the Sentence Transformers library.\n9'
 '[23, 28].\nThroughout this work we use the GDELT dataset as a case study.\nGDELT is a massive collection of\nnews reports that provide a real-time computational record of global events that is published every 15\nminutes. It aggregates information from various news sources, blogs, and social media platforms to construct\na large collection of data including information on people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions.\nEssentially, GDELT offers a snapshot of the world’s collective events, enabling researchers and analysts to\nexplore complex patterns and relationships within global society. By analyzing this data, it’s possible to\nidentify emerging trends, assess risks, understand public sentiment, and track the evolution of various issues\nover time. The applications of GDELT are diverse and far-reaching. Some of the most common use cases\nincluding event monitoring [16, 17, 29], risk assessment and prediction [6, 19, 20, 24, 26, 30], and social\nscience research [2, 3, 4, 12].\nGDELT describes its structure as a Global Knowledge Graph (GKG, specifically, we use the the Global\nKnowledge Graph edition 2 (GKG2) of GDELT). But in fact GDELT-GKG2 is implemented as multiple\nlinked tables recording information about the relationship between articles and events, and thus effectively\nhas the structure of a relational database. Another important contribution of this paper is to actually realize\nGKG2 properly in the mathematical form of a KG, effectively a graph database, derived from and consistent\nwith its native relational database form. To facilitate this effort, we have identified a lightweight ontology\nfor GDELT in the form of its graph schema, realizing its relational database schema in a KG form.\nUsing the KG that we construct from the GDELT-GKG2 dataset, we provide a case study to explore the\nutility of LLM-based tools to extract information and confirm that the KG can be used for question-answering\nin cases where traditional RAG fails. As part of our analysis, we compare to KGs produced from processing\nvarious news articles with an LLM, prompting it to try and adhere to a reduced version of the same ontology.\nThe current state of neurosymbolic work is noted for the plethora of experimental architectures available.\nWhile details are explicated below in Section 3.2, we preview ours in Figure 1, including the five method-\nological pathways which are quantitatively compared: 1) graph queries on the KG (called the DKG) derived\n“directly” from GKG2; 2) use of G-Retriever2 [7] against the same DKG; 3) RAG against a vector store\nrepresentation of GKG2; 4) G-Retriever against a second KG (called the LKG) derived from using Llamain-\ndex3 [1] against the GDELT source articles; and 5) GraphRAG4 Q&A deployed against a third KG (called\nGRKG) using Microsoft’s open-source GraphRAG package with default configuration parameters.\nFigure 1: Pipeline of different experiments ran to analyze the GDELT database using an LLM.\n2https://github.com/XiaoxinHe/G-Retriever\n3https://www.llamaindex.ai/\n4https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/\n2'

This subset of data included\n27 articles with 283 related mentions to 143 events during the Baltimore bridge collapse from midnight to\n10:00 AM EST. The corpus of text was created from web scraping the 27 URLs associated to the articles.\n• Edges of one of the following type: “Related to event where”, “Has quotation”, “Mentions person”,\n“Mentions location”, “Mentions organization”, “Committed action of”, “Has event acted on”, and\n“Affiliated with”, again with the last type serving as a catch-all.\nWhile this reduced description produces a non-trivial knowledge graph, it is worth noting that node and edge\ntypes still struggle to adhere to the prescribed structure, potentially due to the nature of hallucinations. The\nresults are shown in Fig. 4b. This pipeline also struggles with entity and relation resolutions, for example\ncreating separate nodes for ‘Container ship’ and ‘Container ship.’\nThe construction of the GRKG required a language model whose context window exceeded the capabilities\nof Mixtral-8x7B. We decided to use Llama-3.1-8B [22] for this case. It is worth noting that GraphRAG\nindiscriminately generates relations without the prescription of any ontology.\nIt does, however, identify\na specified set of entities with defaults being “organizations”, “persons”, “geo(locations)”, and “events.”\nSimilar to the LlamaIndex pipeline, GraphRAG struggles with entity resolution — an example of which\ncan be seen from the existence of separate nodes for “DALI” and “THE DALI.” It also spawns many small\ncomponents, often being isolated nodes; 435 of 968 total nodes are isolated in this example.\n3.2\nKnowledge Graph Analysis Methodology\nThe three graphs in Fig. 4 show the significant size difference between the DKG, LKG, and GRKG. This is\npotentially due to the summarizing nature of LlamaIndex and GraphRAG to only capture the key edges and\nnodes. Further, we find that the LLM used to create the LKG had considerable trouble with adhering to\nthe prescribed ontology, creating many new edge types outside those originally prescribed. For example, the\nLLM creates a triple (Maersk, Chartered, Container ship) when using LlamaIndex. While factually\ncorrect, the Chartered edge type is not specified in the LLM prompt. Even though the LLM struggles\nto adhere to our proposed structures, many of the edges that are mined from the article text are easily\ninterpretable.\nTo validate the quality of our ontology and to show some of its use cases in an automatic way we provide\na qualitative comparison where we use an LLM for question-answering on the GDELT dataset. In total\n6'

Higher cosine similarity indicates a greater\nsemantic similarity between the predicted and actual answers.\nraw documents or a curated KG should not be of ‘Either/Or’, but rather integration between these two\nmodalities. Our findings demonstrate the significant value of combining the strengths of both approaches.\nWe believe that by combining news articles in the form of a vector store with the rich ontological structure of\nthe GDELT knowledge graph through an LLM interface, the resulting information extraction system would\nallow for better knowledge retrieval than either component alone. Specifically, the direct knowledge graph\n(DKG) excels at answering high-level or aggregate questions, providing a strong foundation of structured\nknowledge. While the vector store is well-suited for identifying local information within the documents that\nmight be missing or less readily accessible in the DKG, GraphRAG has shown effectiveness on both local and\nglobal information. Therefore, we hypothesize that the optimal approach is the integrated system, leveraging\nthe DKG for broad context and the vector store and GraphRAG for detailed, document-specific insights,\nand for enhanced global information retrieval. Further work must be done to determine the extent to which\nthe textual article data can be used to refine the KG produced here; some of our examples showed that\ninformation stored in the DKG does not truthfully reflect the information in the articles. Conversely, we\nmust determine how the constructed KG can be used to better search the associated vector store. Some of\nthese research directions include the following:\n• Use LLMs to add new information to an existing KG by creating new entities or edge relations. Based\noff our observations with LlamaIndex and GraphRAG, we need careful monitoring to ensure that the\nLLM formats its responses to properly adhere to the ontological structures and other existing structures\nin the KG. To this end, it can be beneficial to adapt the triples in the DKG produced here to fine-tune\nthe language model or guide its output with in-context learning.\n• By introducing RAG capabilities, we can fact check the KG against the raw textual information. For\nexample, we found that Niki Fennoy was only mentioned in 3 articles but misattributed to 11 others.\nThe use of LLMs give a potential avenue to fact-check existing relations.\n5\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is under information release number PNNL-SA-209193.\n10'
 'we have five pipelines on how we implement an LLM for talking to GDELT. These pipelines are shown\nin Fig. 1, where in each case, we use an LLM to produce a final answer from the information obtained\nfrom each retrieval method. We note that this final processing is done with models with 7-8B parameters.\nWith the GraphRAG pipeline we use Llama-3-8B [22] for question answering, and in all other cases we use\nMistral-7B [10] in tandem with the E5-large-v2 [25] embedding model. In order, left to right:\n1. Extract knowledge using direct graph queries to probe the DKG. This method requires an analyst to\nconvert a natural language question into a suitable graph query. Consistent with other techniques, we\nthen use an LLM to interpret and repackage the retrieved information.\n2. Use G-retriever to automatically fetch a subgraph of the GDELT Knowledge Graph from a natural\nlanguage question. This subgraph retrieval algorithm requires vectorizing the nodes and edges of the\nknowledge graph using a language embedding model. Once retrieved, the subgraph is fed into an LLM\nfor interpretation.\n3. Construct a knowledge graph by parsing full-text documents (scraped from GDELT URLs) with an\nLLM and LlamaIndex’s functionality. We then proceed as in (2).\n4. Create a Vector Store using the text Corpus and ask questions in a typical RAG setting. This in-\nvolves using a language embedding model to vectorize text articles (after splitting them into 500-token\nchunks). Given a question, we use the same embedding model to vectorize it and, using the Euclidean\nmetric to identify nearby vectors, extract the most similar text snippets. The original question and its\nassociated context are then fed into an LLM to process an answer.\n5. Build a knowledge graph as in (3), using the GraphRAG ecosystem. We also use the provided question-\nanswering capabilities of the GraphRAG package.\nWe note that it is typically unnecessary to use an LLM in method (1) and the answer can often be inferred\nafter seeing the raw output of the graph query. In this case, the LLM effectively repackages the result of the\ngraph query in an expected way. As such, we view this first method as a ‘ground-truth’ on the constructed\nKG. Tautologically, if the DKG can be used to answer a question, then a suitable graph query is able to\nextract the correct answer. Conversely, if the KG cannot be used to answer a given question, then a suitable\ngraph query can prove that the answer cannot be found in the KG.\nIt is worth noting why we only employ graph queries on the DKG and not those constructed using LlamaIndex\nor GraphRAG. As noted in our empirical observations of the LLM-produced knowledge graphs, these graphs\nhave far less structure than GDELT itself. This lack of defined structure makes it difficult to form useful\nand interesting graph queries.\n3.3\nResults\nTable 1 shows a sample of questions that were passed through each of the five pipelines from Fig. 1. Exact\nqueries to the GDELT knowledge graph were generated by searching for keywords in the edge triples com-\nprising the knowledge graph. Specifically, we searched for keywords in these triples by converting each triple\nto a sentence (stored as a string) and searching therein. We then used the edge induced subgraph from the\nedge sentences where keywords were found. The following keywords were used for each question:\n• What is the name of the Bridge that collapsed and what river was it on?: Bridge, Collapse, River\n• What is the name of the ship that collided with the baltimore bridge?: Ship, Collide, Baltimore, Bridge\n• How many articles did CNN published about the baltimore bridge collapse?: CNN, Baltimore, Bridge,\nCollapse\n• On what date did the Baltimore Bridge collapse?: Date, Baltimore, Bridge, Collapse\n• Who is Brandon Scott?: Brandon Scott\n• Who is Niki Fennoy?: Niki Fennoy\n• What are the top themes present in the data?: Has Theme\n7']"
What is the main advatage of GDELT GKG Versoin 2.1 for knowlege graph analysis?,"['INTRODUCTION This codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands GDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards actually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news. It applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to compute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document. To sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening around the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every single day. It has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system on November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an incredible number and diversity of fields. The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent dimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly unimaginable new applications. We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and capabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we are both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original alpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. Due to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create a raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of software packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely complex analytic needs in a single file. Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for direct import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated preprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to extract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package. Thus, users may require more advanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance may be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and network and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook. Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, or other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and size (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in these formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file format needed. The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab- delimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized streamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG. Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, despite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or “.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. The new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards compatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but']","GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1 expands the ability to quantify global human society by representing latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of global news. It connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event into a massive network capturing what’s happening worldwide, its context, involved parties, and global sentiment daily. Version 2.1 integrates new features based on community interest and moves the GKG into production status, supporting a wide array of complex analytic needs in a single raw output format that can be processed with scripting languages like PERL or Python for advanced analysis.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer,"The main advantage of GDELT GKG Version 2.1 for knowledge graph analysis is that it transforms the originally relational and somewhat loosely connected GKG2 dataset into a proper, richly structured knowledge graph (KG) with a lightweight ontology. This enables more effective and precise graph-based querying and analysis.

Key specific advantages of GKG 2.1 include:

- **Proximity Context:** GKG 2.1 introduces approximate character offsets for each reference to an object within the original article, allowing for proximity-based contextualization. This helps associate people, organizations, locations, and roles more accurately within the text, enabling better functional, thematic, and geographic affiliations to be explored.

- **Unique Record Identifiers:** Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier, facilitating precise referencing and integration with other datasets.

- **Expanded and Richer Metadata:** GKG 2.1 includes over 100 new themes, expanded taxonomies (e.g., infectious diseases, ethnic groups, humanitarian organizations), and new fields such as emotional and thematic scores (GCAM), date mentions, quotes, and amounts, enhancing the depth and breadth of information encoded.

- **Inclusion of Articles Without Geographic Data:** Unlike previous versions, GKG 2.1 includes articles even if they lack geocoded locations, broadening the scope of content covered, including topics like cybersecurity and constitutional discourse.

- **Single Data File Format:** Simplifies data handling by consolidating counts and full data into one file.

- **Production-Ready and Stable Format:** GKG 2.1 is a stable, production-level release with a tab-delimited CSV format optimized for fast scanning and parallel processing.

- **Better Support for Multilingual and Real-Time Data:** Incorporates real-time translation of 65 languages and real-time emotional and thematic analysis.

Overall, these enhancements make GKG 2.1 far more suitable for constructing and querying a knowledge graph that captures complex relationships and latent dimensions in global news data, enabling more accurate and comprehensive knowledge graph analysis and question answering compared to previous versions or ad hoc graph constructions.","['2\nConstructing a Knowledge Graph for GDELT\nAs previously mentioned, while the GDELT-GKG2 dataset is not actually natively in the form of a knowledge\ngraph, it is advertised and frequently cited as being one. We believe that we are making a distinct contribution\nto the research community by converting the very popular GKG2 database into a proper KG.\nGKG2 is natively a database of three related tables:\n• expert.csv captures event information;\n• GKG.csv captures article information; and\n• mentions.csv relates which articles mention which events.\nFigure 2: GDELT GKG 2.0 schema relating articles (GKG), mentions, and events (Export).\nThe database schema for these three CSV files is shown in Fig. 2 (see also [9]). The key characteristics of\nthis database relational schema should be interpreted as follows:\n• The three tables are color-coded by Events (green), Mentions (pink), and Articles (blue).\n• The single table of Events is shown in multiple green sub-tables, simply for clarity and convenience to\nlayout a long record structure.\n• Single-headed arrows represent one-to-many relationships between the tables. Specifically:\n– Each Event maps to multiple Mentions via the shared GLOBALEVENTID field.\n– Each Article maps to multiple Mentions via the DocumentIdentifer field on the Article side\nmatching to the MentionIdentifier field on the Mention side.\n• In this way, the Mentions table acts as a “pairs file” recording a many-many relation between Events\nand Articles: each event can be mentioned in multiple articles, and dually each article can men-\ntion many events. Each Article also has both a unique identifier through the GKGRECORDID or the\nDocumentIdentifer fields, since each row in the GKG data represents a single article.\n3'
 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.'
 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but'
 'we have five pipelines on how we implement an LLM for talking to GDELT. These pipelines are shown\nin Fig. 1, where in each case, we use an LLM to produce a final answer from the information obtained\nfrom each retrieval method. We note that this final processing is done with models with 7-8B parameters.\nWith the GraphRAG pipeline we use Llama-3-8B [22] for question answering, and in all other cases we use\nMistral-7B [10] in tandem with the E5-large-v2 [25] embedding model. In order, left to right:\n1. Extract knowledge using direct graph queries to probe the DKG. This method requires an analyst to\nconvert a natural language question into a suitable graph query. Consistent with other techniques, we\nthen use an LLM to interpret and repackage the retrieved information.\n2. Use G-retriever to automatically fetch a subgraph of the GDELT Knowledge Graph from a natural\nlanguage question. This subgraph retrieval algorithm requires vectorizing the nodes and edges of the\nknowledge graph using a language embedding model. Once retrieved, the subgraph is fed into an LLM\nfor interpretation.\n3. Construct a knowledge graph by parsing full-text documents (scraped from GDELT URLs) with an\nLLM and LlamaIndex’s functionality. We then proceed as in (2).\n4. Create a Vector Store using the text Corpus and ask questions in a typical RAG setting. This in-\nvolves using a language embedding model to vectorize text articles (after splitting them into 500-token\nchunks). Given a question, we use the same embedding model to vectorize it and, using the Euclidean\nmetric to identify nearby vectors, extract the most similar text snippets. The original question and its\nassociated context are then fed into an LLM to process an answer.\n5. Build a knowledge graph as in (3), using the GraphRAG ecosystem. We also use the provided question-\nanswering capabilities of the GraphRAG package.\nWe note that it is typically unnecessary to use an LLM in method (1) and the answer can often be inferred\nafter seeing the raw output of the graph query. In this case, the LLM effectively repackages the result of the\ngraph query in an expected way. As such, we view this first method as a ‘ground-truth’ on the constructed\nKG. Tautologically, if the DKG can be used to answer a question, then a suitable graph query is able to\nextract the correct answer. Conversely, if the KG cannot be used to answer a given question, then a suitable\ngraph query can prove that the answer cannot be found in the KG.\nIt is worth noting why we only employ graph queries on the DKG and not those constructed using LlamaIndex\nor GraphRAG. As noted in our empirical observations of the LLM-produced knowledge graphs, these graphs\nhave far less structure than GDELT itself. This lack of defined structure makes it difficult to form useful\nand interesting graph queries.\n3.3\nResults\nTable 1 shows a sample of questions that were passed through each of the five pipelines from Fig. 1. Exact\nqueries to the GDELT knowledge graph were generated by searching for keywords in the edge triples com-\nprising the knowledge graph. Specifically, we searched for keywords in these triples by converting each triple\nto a sentence (stored as a string) and searching therein. We then used the edge induced subgraph from the\nedge sentences where keywords were found. The following keywords were used for each question:\n• What is the name of the Bridge that collapsed and what river was it on?: Bridge, Collapse, River\n• What is the name of the ship that collided with the baltimore bridge?: Ship, Collide, Baltimore, Bridge\n• How many articles did CNN published about the baltimore bridge collapse?: CNN, Baltimore, Bridge,\nCollapse\n• On what date did the Baltimore Bridge collapse?: Date, Baltimore, Bridge, Collapse\n• Who is Brandon Scott?: Brandon Scott\n• Who is Niki Fennoy?: Niki Fennoy\n• What are the top themes present in the data?: Has Theme\n7'
 'of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html'

For all\nother questions, the language model cannot answer the posed questions by itself due to the recency of the\nbridge collapse.\nTo quantitatively evaluate the quality of the answers generated by our different question-answering methods,\nwe require a set of ground truth answers for the questions posed. Table 2 presents these manually curated\nground truth answers, representing the expected correct responses for each question used in our evalua-\ntion. These ground truth answers serve as the benchmark against which the performance of each system is\nmeasured.\nQuestion\nGround Truth\nWhat is the name of the Bridge that collapsed and\nwhat river was it on?\nThe Francis Scott Key Bridge on the Patapsco River.\nWhat is the name of the ship that collided with the\nbaltimore bridge?\nThe ship was named the Dali.\nHow many articles did CNN publish about the Bal-\ntimore bridge collapse?\nCNN published 5 articles.\nOn what date did the Baltimore Bridge collapse?\nThe collapse occurred on March 26, 2024.\nWho is Brandon Scott?\nBrandon Scott is the Mayor of Baltimore.\nWho is Niki Fennoy?\nNiki Fennoy is a city police spokesman.\nWhat are the top themes present in the data?\nThemes include maritime incidents, manmade disaster, and\nwater-related topics.\nTable 2: Ground Truth Answers for the Baltimore Bridge Collapse Questions\nTo further validate our qualitative findings, Figure 5 presents a quantitative comparison of the semantic\nsimilarity of answers generated by the five different methods when querying the GDELT dataset related\nto the Baltimore bridge collapse. We compute the quality of the result by calculating cosine similarity5, a\nmeasure of the similarity between the embeddings of the predicted answer and the ground truth, with higher\nvalues indicating greater accuracy. The box plots illustrate the distribution of these similarity scores for each\nmethod: Graph Query on DKG, G-Retriever on DKG, RAG using Vector Store, G-Retriever on LKG, and\nGraphRAG Q&A on GRKG. As our qualitative analysis suggested, methods leveraging direct graph queries\non the DKG, standard RAG with a vector store, and GraphRAG Q&A on the GRKG generally exhibit the\nhighest cosine similarity scores, providing quantitative evidence for their superior performance in generating\naccurate and relevant answers compared to the G-Retriever, especially with the LKG. This visualization\nquantitatively confirms the trends observed in the qualitative evaluation presented in Table 1.\n4\nConclusion\nThis work has taken the GDELT GKG database and introduced an ontology to create a knowledge graph\nwith rich structure. We found that while the large KG produced by the GDELT-GKG2 database has rich\ninformation for question-answering, the ad hoc techniques for graph exploration deem further investigation\nfor reliable use. That said, the information stored in the KG produced here is not without flaws, and we\nexpect the example studied here to be useful for the broader synergy between KGs and LLMs as addressed\nby others [18]. While the KGs produced using LlamaIndex captured a summary of the events surrounding\nthe Baltimore bridge collapse, the quality of the resulting structure was not suitable for question-answering.\nThose techniques incorporated into the GraphRAG package did considerably better, but there is room for\nimprovement for answering global questions, resolving duplicate entities, and incorporating ontologically-\nguided relation extraction. We believe the incorporation of the ontology into the relation extraction will\nhave the benefit of allowing tools such as GraphRAG to better answer quantitative questions that only the\nontology based KG pipeline (DKG) was able to answer (e.g., the number of articles published on a topic).\nLarge language models continue to be adapted to solve problems across domains, and the case study on the\nKG built here presents much opportunity for future development. In particular, the debate around using\n5The\nsemantic\nembeddings\nused\nto\ncalculate\nthe\ncosine\nsimilarity\nwere\ngenerated\nusing\nthe\nsentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from the Sentence Transformers library.\n9'
 '[23, 28].\nThroughout this work we use the GDELT dataset as a case study.\nGDELT is a massive collection of\nnews reports that provide a real-time computational record of global events that is published every 15\nminutes. It aggregates information from various news sources, blogs, and social media platforms to construct\na large collection of data including information on people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions.\nEssentially, GDELT offers a snapshot of the world’s collective events, enabling researchers and analysts to\nexplore complex patterns and relationships within global society. By analyzing this data, it’s possible to\nidentify emerging trends, assess risks, understand public sentiment, and track the evolution of various issues\nover time. The applications of GDELT are diverse and far-reaching. Some of the most common use cases\nincluding event monitoring [16, 17, 29], risk assessment and prediction [6, 19, 20, 24, 26, 30], and social\nscience research [2, 3, 4, 12].\nGDELT describes its structure as a Global Knowledge Graph (GKG, specifically, we use the the Global\nKnowledge Graph edition 2 (GKG2) of GDELT). But in fact GDELT-GKG2 is implemented as multiple\nlinked tables recording information about the relationship between articles and events, and thus effectively\nhas the structure of a relational database. Another important contribution of this paper is to actually realize\nGKG2 properly in the mathematical form of a KG, effectively a graph database, derived from and consistent\nwith its native relational database form. To facilitate this effort, we have identified a lightweight ontology\nfor GDELT in the form of its graph schema, realizing its relational database schema in a KG form.\nUsing the KG that we construct from the GDELT-GKG2 dataset, we provide a case study to explore the\nutility of LLM-based tools to extract information and confirm that the KG can be used for question-answering\nin cases where traditional RAG fails. As part of our analysis, we compare to KGs produced from processing\nvarious news articles with an LLM, prompting it to try and adhere to a reduced version of the same ontology.\nThe current state of neurosymbolic work is noted for the plethora of experimental architectures available.\nWhile details are explicated below in Section 3.2, we preview ours in Figure 1, including the five method-\nological pathways which are quantitatively compared: 1) graph queries on the KG (called the DKG) derived\n“directly” from GKG2; 2) use of G-Retriever2 [7] against the same DKG; 3) RAG against a vector store\nrepresentation of GKG2; 4) G-Retriever against a second KG (called the LKG) derived from using Llamain-\ndex3 [1] against the GDELT source articles; and 5) GraphRAG4 Q&A deployed against a third KG (called\nGRKG) using Microsoft’s open-source GraphRAG package with default configuration parameters.\nFigure 1: Pipeline of different experiments ran to analyze the GDELT database using an LLM.\n2https://github.com/XiaoxinHe/G-Retriever\n3https://www.llamaindex.ai/\n4https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/\n2'

With direct graph queries, we can answer high-level and other types of questions\nthat need us to aggregate information across the dataset. For example, we can easily extract information\nabout recurrent themes or about a particular news source. While GraphRAG also provides functionality\nto answer high-level questions, we found that its performance lacked in this respect. It performed well on\nfine-grained questions. A vector store performed similarly well on these fine-grained questions that can be\nanswered by a small number of excerpts from the source articles. Notably, the second column suggests that\nthe automated search functionalities provided in G-retriever are often unable to retrieve a subgraph that can\nbe used to provide an accurate answer. The problem gets worse when we use the KG created by LlamaIndex\nas our knowledge base, which is unable to suitably answer any question that we posed. These issues may\npartially be due to the out-of-box application of the G-retriever system and careful fine-tuning may improve\nperformance. Regardless, we see the retained value in directly probing our data with hand-crafted queries\nand infer that further developments are needed for these automated information extraction systems to match\nthe baseline performance on questions that require reasoning across the entire corpus.\nBy combining the results of the direct graph queries on the DKG with those of GraphRAG and standard\nRAG, we can provide suitable answers to the all of the presented questions.

 'adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening \nentirely new analytic opportunities.  Some of the most significant changes: \n \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes.  The GDELT Global Content Analysis \nMeasures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment \nanalysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together \nassess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual \ndimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, \nFrench, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and \nUrdu).  GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents \nand reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from \nLIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Translation of 65 Languages.  GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n\uf0b7 \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.  A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now \nspecify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that \nrepresents the core focus of the article.  GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.

Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.

 'the score of any word-count field to convert to a percentage density score.  As an example, \nassume a document with 125 words.  The General Inquirer dictionary has been assigned the \nDictionaryID of 2 and its “Bodypt” dimension has a DimensionID of 21.  SentiWordNet has a \nDictionaryID of 10 and its “Positive” dimension has a DimensionID of 1.  Thus, the V2GCAM field \nfor a document might look like “wc:125,c2.21:4,c10.1:40,v10.1:3.21111111” indicating that the \ndocument had 125 words, that 4 of those words were found the General Inquirer “Bodypt” \nlexicon, that 40 of those words were found in the SentiWordNet lexicon, and that the average \nnumeric score of all of the words found in the SentiWordNet lexicon was 3.21111111.  For a \ncomplete list of the available dimensions, along with their assigned DictionaryID and \nDimensionID codes, their assigned key, and their human name and full citation to cite that \ndimension, please see the GCAM Master Codebook. 8  NOTE: the scores for all dimensions, both \nEnglish and non-English dimensions, will be listed together in this field – please see the \ncodebooks to determine the source language of a specific dimension.  NOTE: if non-English \ndictionaries are available for a given language and generated at least one match for that \ndocument, an additional “nwc” entry will be added which reflects the word count in the native \nlanguage, since languages may have differing word counts in their native and translated forms.  \nThis count will be absent if no native dictionaries yielded a match for the document. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1SHARINGIMAGE.  (textual URL)  Many news websites specify a so-called “sharing image” for \neach article in which the news outlet manually specifies a particular image to be displayed when \nthat article is shared via social media or other formats.  Not all news outlets specify a sharing \nimage and some sites simply use their logo, but for those that do use this field, it represents the \noutlet’s selection of the single image that best captures the overall focus and contents of the \nstory.  GDELT currently recognizes a variety of formats for specifying this image, including Open \nGraph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats, among others.  \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1RELATEDIMAGES.  (semicolon-delimited list of URLs).  News articles frequently include \nphotographs, figures, and other imagery to illustrate the story, ranging from a single illustrative \nphotograph at top, to lengthy photo essays interspersed through the entirety of an article.  Such \nimagery lends a rich visual tapestry to a news report, helping to clarify, for example, whether an \narticle about a “protest blocking a highway” involves hundreds of activists along its length, or \njust a handful of people in one location, or whether a gas explosion leveled a building or merely \nshattered its windows.  GDELT uses a suite of highly sophisticated algorithms to actually “read” \nthrough each article in the way a human would, evaluating each image on to determine its \nrelevance, based on positioning, captioning, referencing, and context, and compiles a list of the \nURLs of the images it deems to be most relevant to the article.  Thus, unrelated inset boxes, \nadvertisements, and other imagery are ignored and this field contains only a list of images most \nillustrative of the core of the story.  This feature is in alpha release and involves a number of \nhighly complex algorithms working together in concert and thus may make mistakes.  We will be \nimproving this algorithm over time and would appreciate any feedback you may have on the \nkinds of images it incorrectly includes and those that it misses. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1SOCIALIMAGEEMBEDS.  (semicolon-delimited list of URLs).  News websites are increasingly \nembedding image-based social media posts inline in their articles to illustrate them with \nrealtime reaction or citizen reporting from the ground.  GDELT currently recognizes embedded \nimage-based Twitter and Instagram posts and records their URLs in this field.  Only those posts \ncontaining imagery are included in this field.  This acts as a form of social media “curation” in \nwhich news outlets are wading through the deluge of social media reaction or reporting about a \nspecific situation and hand-selecting key image posts deemed of greatest relevance, \n                                                          \n8 http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/GCAM-MASTERCODEBOOK.xlsx'
 'o Word Count.  (integer)  This is the total number of words in the document.  This field \nwas added in version 1.5 of the format. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1ENHANCEDDATES.  (semicolon-delimited blocks, with comma-delimited fields)  This \ncontains a list of all date references in the document, along with the character offsets of \napproximately where in the document they were found.  If a date was mentioned multiple times \nin a document, it will appear multiple times in this field, once for each mention.  Each date \nreference is separated by a semicolon, while the fields within a date are separated by commas.  \nNOTE: this field is identical to GKG 2.0 with the sole exception of the addition of one additional \nDate Resolution type (4 = dates that include a month and day, but not a year). \no Date Resolution.  This indicates whether the date was a month-day date that did not \nspecify a year (4), a fully-resolved day-level date that included the year (3), a month-\nlevel date that included the year but not a day (2), or a year-level (1) date that did not \ninclude month or day-level information. \no Month.  This is the month of the date represented as 1-12.  For year dates this field will \ncontain a 0. \no Day. This is the day of the date represented as 1-31.  For month and year dates this field \nwill contain a 0.  \no Year.  This is the year of the date.  For Resolution=4 dates that include a month and day, \nbut not a year, this field will contain a 0. \no Offset.  This is the character offset of the date within the document, indicating \napproximately where it was found in the body.  This can be used to associate the date \nwith the entries from other “V2ENHANCED” fields that appeared in closest proximity to \nit. \n\uf0b7 \nV2GCAM.  (comma-delimited blocks, with colon-delimited key/value pairs)  The Global Content \nAnalysis Measures (GCAM) system runs an array of content analysis systems over each \ndocument and compiles their results into this field.  New content analysis systems will be \nconstantly added to the GCAM pipeline over time, meaning the set of available fields will \nconstantly grow over time.  Given that the GCAM system is debuting with over 2,300 dimensions \nand will likely grow to include several thousand more dimensions within the coming months, it \ndiffers in its approach to encoding matches from the GKG’s native thematic coding system.  \nInstead of displaying the full English name of a content analysis dictionary or dimension, it \nassigns each dictionary a unique numeric identifier (DictionaryID) and each dimension within \nthat dictionary is assigned a unique identifier from 1 to the number of dimensions in the \ndictionary (DimensionID).  Each dimension of each dictionary is assessed on a document and \nONLY those dimensions that had one or more matches onto the document are reported.  If a \ndimension did not register any matches on a document, it is not reported in order to save space.  \nThus, the absence of a dimension in this field can be interpreted as a score of 0.  Each \ndimension’s score is written to the V2GCAM field separated by a comma.  For each dimension, a \nnumeric “key” identifies it of the form “DictionaryID.DimensionID”, followed by a colon, \nfollowed by its score.  Most dictionaries are count-based, meaning they report how many words \nin the document were found in that dictionary.  Thus, a score of 18 would mean that 18 words \nfrom the document were found in that dictionary.  Count-based dimensions have a key that \nbegins with “c”.  Some dictionaries, such as SentiWordNet and SentiWords actually assign each \nword a numeric score and the output of the tool is the average of those scores for that \ndocument.  For those dictionaries, an entry will report the number of words in the document \nthat matched into that dictionary, and a separate entry, beginning with a “v” instead of a “c” will \nreport its floating-point average value.  The very first entry in the field has the special reserved \nkey of “wc” and reports the total number of words in the document – this can be used to divide'
 'of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html'

Some of the most common use cases\nincluding event monitoring [16, 17, 29], risk assessment and prediction [6, 19, 20, 24, 26, 30], and social\nscience research [2, 3, 4, 12].\nGDELT describes its structure as a Global Knowledge Graph (GKG, specifically, we use the the Global\nKnowledge Graph edition 2 (GKG2) of GDELT). But in fact GDELT-GKG2 is implemented as multiple\nlinked tables recording information about the relationship between articles and events, and thus effectively\nhas the structure of a relational database. Another important contribution of this paper is to actually realize\nGKG2 properly in the mathematical form of a KG, effectively a graph database, derived from and consistent\nwith its native relational database form. To facilitate this effort, we have identified a lightweight ontology\nfor GDELT in the form of its graph schema, realizing its relational database schema in a KG form.\nUsing the KG that we construct from the GDELT-GKG2 dataset, we provide a case study to explore the\nutility of LLM-based tools to extract information and confirm that the KG can be used for question-answering\nin cases where traditional RAG fails. As part of our analysis, we compare to KGs produced from processing\nvarious news articles with an LLM, prompting it to try and adhere to a reduced version of the same ontology.\nThe current state of neurosymbolic work is noted for the plethora of experimental architectures available.\nWhile details are explicated below in Section 3.2, we preview ours in Figure 1, including the five method-\nological pathways which are quantitatively compared: 1) graph queries on the KG (called the DKG) derived\n“directly” from GKG2; 2) use of G-Retriever2 [7] against the same DKG; 3) RAG against a vector store\nrepresentation of GKG2; 4) G-Retriever against a second KG (called the LKG) derived from using Llamain-\ndex3 [1] against the GDELT source articles; and 5) GraphRAG4 Q&A deployed against a third KG (called\nGRKG) using Microsoft’s open-source GraphRAG package with default configuration parameters.\nFigure 1: Pipeline of different experiments ran to analyze the GDELT database using an LLM.\n2https://github.com/XiaoxinHe/G-Retriever\n3https://www.llamaindex.ai/\n4https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/\n2'

GDELT currently recognizes \nYouTube, DailyMotion, Vimeo, and Vine videos embedded in articles and records their URLs in \nthis field.

GDELT identifies and extracts all quoted statements from \neach article and additionally attempts to identify the verb introducing the quote to help lend \nadditional context, separating “John retorted…” from “John agreed…” to show whether the \nspeaker was agreeing with or rejecting the statement being made.  Each quoted statement is \nseparated by a “#” character, and within each block the following fields appear, separated by \npipe (“|”) symbols: \no Offset.  This is the character offset of the quoted statement within the document, \nindicating approximately where it was found in the body.  This can be used to associate \nthe date with the entries from other “V2ENHANCED” fields that appeared in closest \nproximity to it. \no Length.

This field goes beyond people and organizations to \ncapturing a much broader view of the named events, objects, initiatives, laws, and other types \nof names in each article.  Each name reference is separated by a semicolon, and within each \nreference, the name is specified first, followed by a comma, and then the approximate character \noffset of the reference of that name in the document, allowing it to be associated with other \nentries from other “V2ENHANCED” fields that appear in closest proximity to it.

Our findings demonstrate the significant value of combining the strengths of both approaches.\nWe believe that by combining news articles in the form of a vector store with the rich ontological structure of\nthe GDELT knowledge graph through an LLM interface, the resulting information extraction system would\nallow for better knowledge retrieval than either component alone. Specifically, the direct knowledge graph\n(DKG) excels at answering high-level or aggregate questions, providing a strong foundation of structured\nknowledge. While the vector store is well-suited for identifying local information within the documents that\nmight be missing or less readily accessible in the DKG, GraphRAG has shown effectiveness on both local and\nglobal information. Therefore, we hypothesize that the optimal approach is the integrated system, leveraging\nthe DKG for broad context and the vector store and GraphRAG for detailed, document-specific insights,\nand for enhanced global information retrieval. Further work must be done to determine the extent to which\nthe textual article data can be used to refine the KG produced here; some of our examples showed that\ninformation stored in the DKG does not truthfully reflect the information in the articles. Conversely, we\nmust determine how the constructed KG can be used to better search the associated vector store. Some of\nthese research directions include the following:\n• Use LLMs to add new information to an existing KG by creating new entities or edge relations. Based\noff our observations with LlamaIndex and GraphRAG, we need careful monitoring to ensure that the\nLLM formats its responses to properly adhere to the ontological structures and other existing structures\nin the KG. To this end, it can be beneficial to adapt the triples in the DKG produced here to fine-tune\nthe language model or guide its output with in-context learning.\n• By introducing RAG capabilities, we can fact check the KG against the raw textual information. For\nexample, we found that Niki Fennoy was only mentioned in 3 articles but misattributed to 11 others.\nThe use of LLMs give a potential avenue to fact-check existing relations.\n5\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is under information release number PNNL-SA-209193.\n10'
 'THE GDELT EVENT DATABASE \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.0 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their \ndescriptions.  GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, \ncapturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2.  A wide array of variables break \nout the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, \nthe Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique \narray of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both \nactors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the \nstory of each event “in flight” through the global media system. \n \nAt present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, \nhowever in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 \nformat.  The   Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note \nthat files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited).   \n \nWith the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at \nleast through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without \nmodification.  Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning \nFebruary 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches \nback to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. \n  \nThere are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset.  The first is the \ntraditional Event table.  This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several \nchanges as noted below.  In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records \nall mentions of each event.  As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those \nmentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, \nincluding the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus \nbeing buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event \nfrom that specific news report.  The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it \npossible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases.  Those wishing to find the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of \nperiod “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest \nevents with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the \nhighest Confidence measures.  This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each \nindividual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below).  It also makes it possible to \nidentify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those \nwith the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific \nsource language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).']"

These date mentions include day, month, and year dates, and are recorded in a specific field called **V2.1ENHANCEDDATES**. This field contains a semicolon-delimited list of all date references in the document, with each date mention including:

- **Date Resolution**: Indicates the specificity of the date (year-level, month-level, day-level, or month-day without year).
- **Month**: The month part of the date (1-12), or 0 if not applicable.
- **Day**: The day part of the date (1-31), or 0 if not applicable.
- **Year**: The year part of the date, or 0 if not applicable.
- **Offset**: The approximate character offset within the document where the date mention was found.

This detailed encoding allows GKG to capture multiple mentions of the same or different dates within a single document, including partial dates (e.g., month and day without year).

---

### Role of Proximity Context in Date Mentions

The **Proximity Context** capability is a significant enhancement introduced in GKG 2.1 that records the approximate character offsets of references to various objects (including dates) within the original article text. This allows the system to associate date mentions with other entities or thematic elements based on their closeness in the text.

- By using the character offset information, the GKG can link date mentions to nearby mentions of people, organizations, locations, or events.
- This proximity-based contextualization helps disambiguate and enrich the semantic relationships in the knowledge graph, such as associating a specific date with a particular event or actor mentioned close by in the text.
- Although it does not provide deep semantic parsing, proximity context enables simple yet effective contextual associations, improving the ability to analyze the functional, thematic, and geographic affiliations of date mentions and other entities.

---

### Summary

- **Date Mentions** in GKG are comprehensively extracted and encoded with detailed resolution and location information within documents.
- **Proximity Context** uses character offsets to relate these date mentions to other entities and concepts in the text based on their textual closeness, enhancing the semantic richness and analytic potential of the GKG data.","['• Solid edges indicate a field in a relational table and are labeled with the type of semantic relation.\n• Dashed and bold edges indicate the structural, one-to-many relations in the relational schema.\nThe naming convention also captures the unique identifier for these csv files, so that ⟨GLOBALEVENTID⟩\nidentifies unique Events, the pair (⟨GLOBALEVENTID⟩, ⟨MentionIdentifier⟩) identifies unique Mentions, as\ndoes ⟨DocumentIdentifier⟩for Articles. We again note that the document and mention identifiers are the\nsame field, but have different field names (e.g., a URL is typically used for the document identifier and the\nsame URL is used for the mention identifier).\n3\nCase Study - Baltimore Bridge Collapse\nHere we will provide an analysis of data collected over a recent and short period of time to do question-\nanswering based analysis. The point of collecting recent data is that the LLMs used have not yet been\ntrained on these events (at the time of this study) and thus the knowledge systems are needed to supply\nthe LLM with relevant information. Specifically, this analysis uses a subset of the GDELT data collected\non March 26th of 2024 from 12:00 AM to 10:00 AM during and after the collapse of the Francis Scott Key\nBridge in Baltimore, Maryland, which occurred at approximately 1:29 AM. This 10 hour window of time\ncaptures the media response to this disaster. We filtered down the collected mentions data to only include\nrows in any of the related data if it included any of the keywords “Baltimore”, “bridge”, “collapse”, or\n“ship”. We then used all GLOBALEVENTIDs and MentionIdentifiers in this reduced mentions file to collect\nthe relevant events and articles. This filtration resulted in using approximately 1.33% of the available data\nwith 371 events, 2047 mentions, and 209 articles.\n3.1\nGDELT Knowledge Graphs\nUsing the GDELT data directly and the scraped text we can construct a total of three KGs:\nDirect KG (DKG): The first KG was simply a direct conversion of the subset of the original GDELT data\ninto an equivalent KG as specified by our ontology in Fig. 3. This KG is shown in Fig. 4a.\nLlamaIndex KG (LKG): The second KG was generated by an LLM deployed against a text corpus con-\nsisting of the source articles collected by scraping URLs of the 209 articles included in our GDELT\nsubset, and enriched with knowledge of the ontology. This KG is shown in Fig. 4b.\nGraphRAG KG (GRKG): The final KG was generated using the same articles as the LKG, using Mi-\ncrosoft’s open-source GraphRAG package with default configuration parameters. This KG is shown in\nFig. 4c.\nThe example KG constructed using our ontology (DKG) is shown in a reduced form in Fig. 4a. The nodes\nare color coded based on their source. Note that node and edge labels are not shown in order to facilitate\nclarity. This KG is one component and has 3,469 nodes and 18,052 edges.\nTo construct a KG directly from the corpus of source document text (LKG) shown in Fig. 4b, we used\nMixtral-8x7B [11] as our base model, following the procedure outlined by the LlamaIndex package developers\n[1]. The LLM is prompted to extract triples from the news articles according to a prompt provided in the\nparameter kg triplet prompt. Using the default prompt, the ontology does not get incorporated and the\nresulting KG is a star-shaped graph with a single central node and all other nodes connected to this center,\nthere being no other edges. When we change the prompt to consider the entire ontology, we again get a\nstar-shaped graph. Nontrivial graph structure arose when we prompted the language model with a reduced\nversion of the ontology with adaptation for unstructured text. In particular, our prompt asked for:\n• Vertices of one of the following types: “Event”, “Article”, “Mention”, “Person”, “Quotation”, “Orga-\nnization”, “Location”, and “Other”, with the last type serving as a catch-all.\n5'
 'adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening \nentirely new analytic opportunities.  Some of the most significant changes: \n \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes.  The GDELT Global Content Analysis \nMeasures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment \nanalysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together \nassess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual \ndimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, \nFrench, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and \nUrdu).  GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents \nand reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from \nLIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Translation of 65 Languages.  GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n\uf0b7 \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.  A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now \nspecify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that \nrepresents the core focus of the article.  GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.  This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations \nanywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act \nas a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \n\uf0b7 \nQuotes, Names, and Amounts.  The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food \nprices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable \nitem.  GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to \noffer numeric context to global events.  In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing \nPerson and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, \nsuch as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World \nCup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran \nNuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n\uf0b7 \nDate Mentions.  We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references \nfound in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates \nas possible “anniversary violence” indicators.  All day, month, and year dates are now extracted \nfrom each document. \n\uf0b7 \nProximity Context.  Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the \nintroduction of the new Proximity Context capability.  The GKG records an enormously rich array'
 'Finally, a set of fields at the end of the record provide additional data management information for the \nevent record.   \n \n\uf0b7 \nDATEADDED. (integer) This field stores the date the event was added to the master database \nin YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format in the UTC timezone.  For those needing to access events at 15 \nminute resolution, this is the field that should be used in queries. \n\uf0b7 \nSOURCEURL.  (string) This field records the URL or citation of the first news report it found this \nevent in.  In most cases this is the first report it saw the article in, but due to the timing and \nflow of news reports through the processing pipeline, this may not always be the very first \nreport, but is at least in the first few reports. \n \n \n \nMENTIONS TABLE \n \nThe Mentions table is a new addition to GDELT 2.0 and records each mention of the events in the Event \ntable, making it possible to track the trajectory and network structure of a story as it flows through the \nglobal media system.  Each mention of an event receives its own entry in the Mentions table – thus an \nevent which is mentioned in 100 articles will be listed 100 times in the Mentions table.  Mentions are \nrecorded irrespective of the date of the original event, meaning that a mention today of an event from a \nyear ago will still be recorded, making it possible to trace discussion of “anniversary events” or historical \nevents being recontextualized into present actions.  If a news report mentions multiple events, each \nmention is recorded separately in this table.  For translated documents, all measures below are based \non its English translation. \n \nSeveral of the new measures recorded in the Mentions table make it possible to better filter events \nbased on how confident GDELT was in its extraction of that event.  When trying to understand news \nmedia spanning the entire globe, one finds that journalism is rife with ambiguities, assumed background \nknowledge, and complex linguistic structures.  Not every event mention will take the form of “American \nPresident Barack Obama met with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday at a trade summit in Paris, \nFrance.”  Instead, an event mention might more commonly appear as “Obama and Putin were in Paris \nyesterday for a trade summit.  The two leaders met backstage where he discussed his policy on \nUkraine.”  To which of the two leader(s) do “he” and “his” refer?  Is Obama discussing Obama’s policy on \nUkraine, or is Obama discussing Putin’s policy on Ukraine, or is it Putin discussing Putin’s policy or \nperhaps Putin discussing Obama’s policy?  While additional cues may be available in the surrounding \ntext, ambiguous event mentions like this are exceptionally common across the world’s media.  Similarly, \nit would be difficult indeed to maintain an exhaustive list of every single political figure in the entire \nworld and thus context is often critical for disambiguating the geographic affiliation of an actor.  Even in \nthe case of more senior political leadership, a reference to “Renauld’s press conference this afternoon in \nPort-au-Prince” most likely refers to Lener Renauld, the Minister of Defense of Haiti, but this \ndisambiguation still carries with it some degree of ambiguity.  GDELT makes use of an array of natural \nlanguage processing algorithms like coreference and deep parsing using whole-of-document context.  \nWhile these enormously increase GDELT’s ability to understand and extract ambiguous and linguistically \ncomplex events, such extractions also come with a higher potential for error.  Under GDELT 1.0, the \nNumMentions field as designed as a composite score of the absolute number of unique documents \nmentioning an event and the number of revisions to the text required by these various algorithms, up to \nsix revision passes.  Under GDELT 2.0, the Mentions table now separates these, with each record in the \nMentions table recording an individual mention of an event in an article, while the new Confidence field'
 'EVENT TABLE \n \nEVENTID AND DATE ATTRIBUTES \n \nThe first few fields of an event record capture its globally unique identifier number, the date the event \ntook place on, and several alternatively formatted versions of the date designed to make it easier to \nwork with the event records in different analytical software programs that may have specific date \nformat requirements.  The parenthetical after each variable name gives the datatype of that field. \n \nNote that even though GDELT 2.0 operates at a 15 minute resolution, the date fields in this section still \nrecord the date at the daily level, since this is the resolution that event analysis has historically been \nperformed at.  To examine events at the 15 minute resolution, use the DATEADDED field (the second \nfrom the last field in this table at the end).  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGlobalEventID.  (integer) Globally unique identifier assigned to each event record that uniquely \nidentifies it in the master dataset.  NOTE: While these will often be sequential with date, this is \nNOT always the case and this field should NOT be used to sort events by date: the date fields \nshould be used for this.  NOTE: There is a large gap in the sequence between February 18, 2015 \nand February 19, 2015 with the switchover to GDELT 2.0 – these are not missing events, the ID \nsequence was simply reset at a higher number so that it is possible to easily distinguish events \ncreated after the switchover to GDELT 2.0 from those created using the older GDELT 1.0 system. \n\uf0b7 \nDay.  (integer) Date the event took place in YYYYMMDD format.  See DATEADDED field for \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS date. \n\uf0b7 \nMonthYear.  (integer) Alternative formatting of the event date, in YYYYMM format. \n\uf0b7 \nYear.  (integer) Alternative formatting of the event date, in YYYY format. \n\uf0b7 \nFractionDate.  (floating point) Alternative formatting of the event date, computed as YYYY.FFFF, \nwhere FFFF is the percentage of the year completed by that day.  This collapses the month and \nday into a fractional range from 0 to 0.9999, capturing the 365 days of the year.  The fractional \ncomponent (FFFF) is computed as (MONTH * 30 + DAY) / 365.  This is an approximation and does \nnot correctly take into account the differing numbers of days in each month or leap years, but \noffers a simple single-number sorting mechanism for applications that wish to estimate the \nrough temporal distance between dates. \n \n \nACTOR ATTRIBUTES \n \nThe next fields describe attributes and characteristics of the two actors involved in the event.  This \nincludes the complete raw CAMEO code for each actor, its proper name, and associated attributes.  The \nraw CAMEO code for each actor contains an array of coded attributes indicating geographic, ethnic, and \nreligious affiliation and the actor’s role in the environment (political elite, military officer, rebel, etc).  \nThese 3-character codes may be combined in any order and are concatenated together to form the final \nraw actor CAMEO code.  To make it easier to utilize this information in analysis, this section breaks these \ncodes out into a set of individual fields that can be separately queried.  NOTE: all attributes in this \nsection other than CountryCode are derived from the TABARI ACTORS dictionary and are NOT \nsupplemented from information in the text.  Thus, if the text refers to a group as “Radicalized'
 'of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html'

 '2\nConstructing a Knowledge Graph for GDELT\nAs previously mentioned, while the GDELT-GKG2 dataset is not actually natively in the form of a knowledge\ngraph, it is advertised and frequently cited as being one. We believe that we are making a distinct contribution\nto the research community by converting the very popular GKG2 database into a proper KG.\nGKG2 is natively a database of three related tables:\n• expert.csv captures event information;\n• GKG.csv captures article information; and\n• mentions.csv relates which articles mention which events.\nFigure 2: GDELT GKG 2.0 schema relating articles (GKG), mentions, and events (Export).\nThe database schema for these three CSV files is shown in Fig. 2 (see also [9]). The key characteristics of\nthis database relational schema should be interpreted as follows:\n• The three tables are color-coded by Events (green), Mentions (pink), and Articles (blue).\n• The single table of Events is shown in multiple green sub-tables, simply for clarity and convenience to\nlayout a long record structure.\n• Single-headed arrows represent one-to-many relationships between the tables. Specifically:\n– Each Event maps to multiple Mentions via the shared GLOBALEVENTID field.\n– Each Article maps to multiple Mentions via the DocumentIdentifer field on the Article side\nmatching to the MentionIdentifier field on the Mention side.\n• In this way, the Mentions table acts as a “pairs file” recording a many-many relation between Events\nand Articles: each event can be mentioned in multiple articles, and dually each article can men-\ntion many events. Each Article also has both a unique identifier through the GKGRECORDID or the\nDocumentIdentifer fields, since each row in the GKG data represents a single article.\n3'
 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but'
 'records GDELT’s confidence in its extraction of that event from that particular article.  This field is a \npercent, ranging from 10 to 100% and indicates how aggressively GDELT had to perform tasks like \ncoreference or grammatical restructuring to extract the event from that article.  Sorting all mentions of \nan event by this field makes it possible to identify articles featuring the strongest and most \nunambiguous discussion of an event. \n \n\uf0b7 \nGlobalEventID.  (integer)  This is the ID of the event that was mentioned in the article. \n\uf0b7 \nEventTimeDate.  (integer)  This is the 15-minute timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) when the \nevent being mentioned was first recorded by GDELT (the DATEADDED field of the original event \nrecord).  This field can be compared against the next one to identify events being mentioned for \nthe first time (their first mentions) or to identify events of a particular vintage being mentioned \nnow (such as filtering for mentions of events at least one week old). \n\uf0b7 \nMentionTimeDate.  (integer)  This is the 15-minute timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) of the \ncurrent update.  This is identical for all entries in the update file but is included to make it easier \nto load the Mentions table into a database.   \n\uf0b7 \nMentionType.  (integer)  This is a numeric identifier that refers to the source collection the \ndocument came from and is used to interpret the MentionIdentifier in the next column.  In \nessence, it specifies how to interpret the MentionIdentifier to locate the actual document.  At \npresent, it can hold one of the following values: \no 1 = WEB (The document originates from the open web and the MentionIdentifier is a \nfully-qualified URL that can be used to access the document on the web). \no 2 = CITATIONONLY (The document originates from a broadcast, print, or other offline \nsource in which only a textual citation is available for the document.  In this case the \nMentionIdentifier contains the textual citation for the document). \no 3 = CORE (The document originates from the CORE archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through the CORE \nwebsite). \no 4 = DTIC (The document originates from the DTIC archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through the DTIC website). \no 5 = JSTOR (The document originates from the JSTOR archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through your JSTOR \nsubscription if your institution subscribes to it). \no 6 = NONTEXTUALSOURCE (The document originates from a textual proxy (such as closed \ncaptioning) of a non-textual information source (such as a video) available via a URL and \nthe MentionIdentifier provides the URL of the non-textual original source.  At present, \nthis Collection Identifier is used for processing of the closed captioning streams of the \nInternet Archive Television News Archive in which each broadcast is available via a URL, \nbut the URL offers access only to the video of the broadcast and does not provide any \naccess to the textual closed captioning used to generate the metadata.  This code is \nused in order to draw a distinction between URL-based textual material (Collection \nIdentifier 1 (WEB) and URL-based non-textual material like the Television News Archive). \n\uf0b7 \nMentionSourceName.  (integer)  This is a human-friendly identifier of the source of the \ndocument.  For material originating from the open web with a URL this field will contain the top-\nlevel domain the page was from.  For BBC Monitoring material it will contain “BBC Monitoring” \nand for JSTOR material it will contain “JSTOR.”  This field is intended for human display of major \nsources as well as for network analysis of information flows by source, obviating the \nrequirement to perform domain or other parsing of the MentionIdentifier field.'
 'o Word Count.  (integer)  This is the total number of words in the document.  This field \nwas added in version 1.5 of the format. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1ENHANCEDDATES.  (semicolon-delimited blocks, with comma-delimited fields)  This \ncontains a list of all date references in the document, along with the character offsets of \napproximately where in the document they were found.  If a date was mentioned multiple times \nin a document, it will appear multiple times in this field, once for each mention.  Each date \nreference is separated by a semicolon, while the fields within a date are separated by commas.  \nNOTE: this field is identical to GKG 2.0 with the sole exception of the addition of one additional \nDate Resolution type (4 = dates that include a month and day, but not a year). \no Date Resolution.  This indicates whether the date was a month-day date that did not \nspecify a year (4), a fully-resolved day-level date that included the year (3), a month-\nlevel date that included the year but not a day (2), or a year-level (1) date that did not \ninclude month or day-level information. \no Month.  This is the month of the date represented as 1-12.  For year dates this field will \ncontain a 0. \no Day. This is the day of the date represented as 1-31.  For month and year dates this field \nwill contain a 0.  \no Year.  This is the year of the date.  For Resolution=4 dates that include a month and day, \nbut not a year, this field will contain a 0. \no Offset.  This is the character offset of the date within the document, indicating \napproximately where it was found in the body.  This can be used to associate the date \nwith the entries from other “V2ENHANCED” fields that appeared in closest proximity to \nit. \n\uf0b7 \nV2GCAM.  (comma-delimited blocks, with colon-delimited key/value pairs)  The Global Content \nAnalysis Measures (GCAM) system runs an array of content analysis systems over each \ndocument and compiles their results into this field.  New content analysis systems will be \nconstantly added to the GCAM pipeline over time, meaning the set of available fields will \nconstantly grow over time.  Given that the GCAM system is debuting with over 2,300 dimensions \nand will likely grow to include several thousand more dimensions within the coming months, it \ndiffers in its approach to encoding matches from the GKG’s native thematic coding system.  \nInstead of displaying the full English name of a content analysis dictionary or dimension, it \nassigns each dictionary a unique numeric identifier (DictionaryID) and each dimension within \nthat dictionary is assigned a unique identifier from 1 to the number of dimensions in the \ndictionary (DimensionID).  Each dimension of each dictionary is assessed on a document and \nONLY those dimensions that had one or more matches onto the document are reported.  If a \ndimension did not register any matches on a document, it is not reported in order to save space.  \nThus, the absence of a dimension in this field can be interpreted as a score of 0.  Each \ndimension’s score is written to the V2GCAM field separated by a comma.  For each dimension, a \nnumeric “key” identifies it of the form “DictionaryID.DimensionID”, followed by a colon, \nfollowed by its score.  Most dictionaries are count-based, meaning they report how many words \nin the document were found in that dictionary.  Thus, a score of 18 would mean that 18 words \nfrom the document were found in that dictionary.  Count-based dimensions have a key that \nbegins with “c”.  Some dictionaries, such as SentiWordNet and SentiWords actually assign each \nword a numeric score and the output of the tool is the average of those scores for that \ndocument.  For those dictionaries, an entry will report the number of words in the document \nthat matched into that dictionary, and a separate entry, beginning with a “v” instead of a “c” will \nreport its floating-point average value.  The very first entry in the field has the special reserved \nkey of “wc” and reports the total number of words in the document – this can be used to divide']"

A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now specify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that represents the core focus of the article. GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats including Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats. In addition, GDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to identify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded social media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is compiled. This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations anywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act as a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \uf0b7 Quotes, Names, and Amounts.

In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing Person and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, such as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World Cup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran Nuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.

### How NLP Algorithms Enable Multilingual Sentiment Analysis

1. **GCAM Module for Emotion and Theme Measurement:**
   - The GCAM module represents one of the largest deployments of sentiment analysis globally.
   - It integrates 24 different emotional measurement packages that collectively assess over 2,300 emotions and themes in real time.
   - GCAM natively supports sentiment and emotional analysis in 15 languages, including Arabic, Chinese, French, Hindi, Korean, Russian, Spanish, and others.
   - This module captures a wide array of emotional dimensions, ranging from LIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity,” WordNet Affect’s “Smugness,” and RID’s “Passivity,” enabling a nuanced and comprehensive emotional profiling of news content.
   - By applying these sophisticated NLP algorithms directly to articles in their native languages, GCAM can assess emotional undercurrents without losing cultural or linguistic context.

2. **GDELT Translingual System for Real-time Translation:**
   - GDELT Translingual is a massive real-time streaming news machine translation system that translates news from 65 languages into English.
   - This system covers 98.4% of GDELT’s daily non-English news volume, effectively removing language barriers.
   - Once translated into English, the news content is processed through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.
   - This allows the system to monitor global news at full volume and trace people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems.
   - The combination of native multilingual sentiment analysis (via GCAM) and broad translation coverage (via Translingual) ensures comprehensive, real-time sentiment analysis on a planetary scale.

### New Analytic Opportunities from Integrating GCAM and GDELT Translingual

- **Planetary-Scale Emotional Underlying Assessment:**
  - The integration enables unparalleled assessment of global emotional undercurrents by combining native multilingual emotional measurement with real-time translation of a vast array of languages.
  - Analysts can detect subtle emotional trends and reactions worldwide as they unfold, across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.

- **Cross-Language and Cross-Media Tracking:**
  - The system can trace emotions, themes, and entities (people, organizations, locations) across different languages and media outlets, providing a unified global perspective.
  - This capability allows for the identification of how emotions and narratives propagate and evolve internationally.

- **Real-Time Monitoring and Early Warning:**
  - The real-time nature of both GCAM and Translingual allows for immediate detection of shifts in sentiment and emotional tone, which can be critical for early warning systems related to social unrest, political developments, or humanitarian crises.

- **Rich Multidimensional Emotional Profiling:**
  - With over 2,300 emotions and themes measured, the system offers a highly granular emotional landscape, enabling detailed analysis beyond simple positive/negative sentiment.
  - This richness supports more sophisticated social science research, risk assessment, and policy analysis.

- **Enhanced Contextualization and Disambiguation:**
  - The GKG’s structure, combined with NLP techniques like coreference resolution and deep parsing, helps associate emotions with specific actors, locations, and events, improving the interpretability of sentiment data.

In summary, the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph leverages advanced NLP algorithms through the GCAM module’s native multilingual emotional analysis and the GDELT Translingual system’s extensive real-time translation capabilities. This integration breaks down language barriers and enables comprehensive, real-time, and nuanced sentiment analysis across the globe, opening new analytic opportunities for understanding global emotional undercurrents and their dynamics as they happen.","['adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening \nentirely new analytic opportunities.

GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n\uf0b7 \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.  A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now \nspecify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that \nrepresents the core focus of the article.  GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.  This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations \nanywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act \nas a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \n\uf0b7 \nQuotes, Names, and Amounts.  The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food \nprices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable \nitem.  GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to \noffer numeric context to global events.  In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing \nPerson and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, \nsuch as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World \nCup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran \nNuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n\uf0b7 \nDate Mentions.  We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references \nfound in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates \nas possible “anniversary violence” indicators.  All day, month, and year dates are now extracted \nfrom each document. \n\uf0b7 \nProximity Context.  Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the \nintroduction of the new Proximity Context capability.  The GKG records an enormously rich array'
 'arXiv:2503.07584v3  [cs.IR]  24 Jun 2025\nTalking to GDELT Through Knowledge Graphs\nAudun Myers, Max Vargas, Sinan G. Aksoy, Cliff Joslyn, Benjamin Wilson,\nLee Burke, Tom Grimes\nAbstract\nIn this work we study various Retrieval Augmented Regeneration (RAG) approaches to gain an\nunderstanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in a question-answering analysis. To\ngain this understanding we use a case-study subset of the Global Database of Events, Language, and\nTone (GDELT) dataset as well as a corpus of raw text scraped from the online news articles. To retrieve\ninformation from the text corpus we implement a traditional vector store RAG as well as state-of-the-art\nlarge language model (LLM) based approaches for automatically constructing KGs and retrieving the\nrelevant subgraphs. In addition to these corpus approaches, we develop a novel ontology-based framework\nfor constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from GDELT directly which leverages the underlying schema\nof GDELT to create structured representations of global events. For retrieving relevant information from\nthe ontology-based KGs we implement both direct graph queries and state-of-the-art graph retrieval\napproaches. We compare the performance of each method in a question-answering task. We find that\nwhile our ontology-based KGs are valuable for question-answering, automated extraction of the relevant\nsubgraphs is challenging. Conversely, LLM-generated KGs, while capturing event summaries, often lack\nconsistency and interpretability. Our findings suggest benefits of a synergistic approach between ontology\nand LLM-based KG construction, with proposed avenues toward that end.\n1\nIntroduction\nIn this work we study several approaches for communicating with a corpus of text via relevant text and\nknowledge graph (KG) representation and retrieval facilitated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our\ngoal is to understand the benefits and drawbacks of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches to\ncorpus management and anlysis when combined with an LLM. Throughout we use as a case study a novel\nKG derived from the Global Data on Events, Location, and Tone (GDELT)1 [13] dataset.\nAs a way to enhance LLM outputs, researchers and practitioners have been quick in applying LLMs to\nquery and understand proprietary data through retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) [14]. It has been\nshown that reasoning over the typical RAG framework, which only takes advantage of the unstructured text\narticles, fails to capture global information about the provided data [5, 27].\nMotivated by this limitation, there has been recent interest in adapting these techniques to the case where\nour data has a graph structure, so that the LLM can directly ingest important relationships in the knowledge\nbase [5, 7, 15, 31]. More specifically, KGs [8] are graph structures which are richly attributed with typing\nand semantic information on both nodes and edges. KG techniques provide ways to automatically query\nand extract information stored in a KG without the user explicitly needing to understand query languages\nto probe their knowledge base. Typically, these AI-based search algorithms find subgraphs that can be used\nto answer a user-provided query.\nThe interactions between KGs and LLMs have potential beyond merely question-answering and knowledge\nextraction (see different research directions outlined by Pan et al. [18]). In particular, reflective of KGs\nbeing used to enhance LLM outputs, LLMs can be used to enhance existing KGs or create new ones entirely\nfrom scratch. However, exploration of techniques to this end either (1) do not deal with imposing different\nontological structures in graph creation or (2) only focus on extracting ontological structures using LLMs\n1https://www.gdeltproject.org/\n1'
 '[23, 28].\nThroughout this work we use the GDELT dataset as a case study.\nGDELT is a massive collection of\nnews reports that provide a real-time computational record of global events that is published every 15\nminutes. It aggregates information from various news sources, blogs, and social media platforms to construct\na large collection of data including information on people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions.\nEssentially, GDELT offers a snapshot of the world’s collective events, enabling researchers and analysts to\nexplore complex patterns and relationships within global society. By analyzing this data, it’s possible to\nidentify emerging trends, assess risks, understand public sentiment, and track the evolution of various issues\nover time. The applications of GDELT are diverse and far-reaching. Some of the most common use cases\nincluding event monitoring [16, 17, 29], risk assessment and prediction [6, 19, 20, 24, 26, 30], and social\nscience research [2, 3, 4, 12].\nGDELT describes its structure as a Global Knowledge Graph (GKG, specifically, we use the the Global\nKnowledge Graph edition 2 (GKG2) of GDELT). But in fact GDELT-GKG2 is implemented as multiple\nlinked tables recording information about the relationship between articles and events, and thus effectively\nhas the structure of a relational database. Another important contribution of this paper is to actually realize\nGKG2 properly in the mathematical form of a KG, effectively a graph database, derived from and consistent\nwith its native relational database form. To facilitate this effort, we have identified a lightweight ontology\nfor GDELT in the form of its graph schema, realizing its relational database schema in a KG form.\nUsing the KG that we construct from the GDELT-GKG2 dataset, we provide a case study to explore the\nutility of LLM-based tools to extract information and confirm that the KG can be used for question-answering\nin cases where traditional RAG fails. As part of our analysis, we compare to KGs produced from processing\nvarious news articles with an LLM, prompting it to try and adhere to a reduced version of the same ontology.\nThe current state of neurosymbolic work is noted for the plethora of experimental architectures available.\nWhile details are explicated below in Section 3.2, we preview ours in Figure 1, including the five method-\nological pathways which are quantitatively compared: 1) graph queries on the KG (called the DKG) derived\n“directly” from GKG2; 2) use of G-Retriever2 [7] against the same DKG; 3) RAG against a vector store\nrepresentation of GKG2; 4) G-Retriever against a second KG (called the LKG) derived from using Llamain-\ndex3 [1] against the GDELT source articles; and 5) GraphRAG4 Q&A deployed against a third KG (called\nGRKG) using Microsoft’s open-source GraphRAG package with default configuration parameters.\nFigure 1: Pipeline of different experiments ran to analyze the GDELT database using an LLM.\n2https://github.com/XiaoxinHe/G-Retriever\n3https://www.llamaindex.ai/\n4https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/\n2'
 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but'

Higher cosine similarity indicates a greater\nsemantic similarity between the predicted and actual answers.\nraw documents or a curated KG should not be of ‘Either/Or’, but rather integration between these two\nmodalities. Our findings demonstrate the significant value of combining the strengths of both approaches.\nWe believe that by combining news articles in the form of a vector store with the rich ontological structure of\nthe GDELT knowledge graph through an LLM interface, the resulting information extraction system would\nallow for better knowledge retrieval than either component alone. Specifically, the direct knowledge graph\n(DKG) excels at answering high-level or aggregate questions, providing a strong foundation of structured\nknowledge. While the vector store is well-suited for identifying local information within the documents that\nmight be missing or less readily accessible in the DKG, GraphRAG has shown effectiveness on both local and\nglobal information. Therefore, we hypothesize that the optimal approach is the integrated system, leveraging\nthe DKG for broad context and the vector store and GraphRAG for detailed, document-specific insights,\nand for enhanced global information retrieval. Further work must be done to determine the extent to which\nthe textual article data can be used to refine the KG produced here; some of our examples showed that\ninformation stored in the DKG does not truthfully reflect the information in the articles. Conversely, we\nmust determine how the constructed KG can be used to better search the associated vector store. Some of\nthese research directions include the following:\n• Use LLMs to add new information to an existing KG by creating new entities or edge relations. Based\noff our observations with LlamaIndex and GraphRAG, we need careful monitoring to ensure that the\nLLM formats its responses to properly adhere to the ontological structures and other existing structures\nin the KG. To this end, it can be beneficial to adapt the triples in the DKG produced here to fine-tune\nthe language model or guide its output with in-context learning.\n• By introducing RAG capabilities, we can fact check the KG against the raw textual information. For\nexample, we found that Niki Fennoy was only mentioned in 3 articles but misattributed to 11 others.\nThe use of LLMs give a potential avenue to fact-check existing relations.\n5\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is under information release number PNNL-SA-209193.\n10'

 'of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html'

   - The **DATEADDED** field records the exact timestamp (in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format, UTC) when an event was added to the master database, providing a 15-minute resolution.  
   - This fine-grained temporal marker allows users to query and analyze events with precise timing, which is critical for real-time monitoring and understanding the sequence of events as they unfold.  
   - While the traditional event date fields in GDELT record dates at the daily level, **DATEADDED** enables temporal analysis at a much finer scale, supporting detailed temporal dynamics and event sequencing.

2. **Detailed Event Mentions and Network Structure via the Mentions Table**:  
   - The **Mentions** table records every individual mention of an event across multiple news articles, capturing the trajectory and propagation of the event through the global media system.  
   - Each mention includes its own timestamp (**MentionTimeDate**) and the original event timestamp (**EventTimeDate**, which corresponds to the event’s **DATEADDED**), allowing for temporal comparison between when an event occurred and when it was reported or re-mentioned.  
   - This enables tracking of how news about an event spreads over time, including mentions of historical or anniversary events, thus revealing the temporal evolution and persistence of event narratives.  
   - The Mentions table also captures network structure by linking events to multiple articles and sources, recording metadata such as mention prominence within articles and confidence scores, which help filter and prioritize mentions based on reliability and salience.

3. **Complementarity in Managing Temporal and Network Dimensions**:  
   - **DATEADDED** provides a precise anchor point for the event’s initial recording, which is essential for establishing the event’s temporal origin in the dataset.  
   - The Mentions table builds on this by documenting the ongoing media coverage and re-mentions of the event, effectively mapping the event’s diffusion and networked presence across different media sources and over time.  
   - By comparing **EventTimeDate** (from **DATEADDED**) with **MentionTimeDate**, analysts can identify first mentions, subsequent mentions, and the longevity or resurgence of event coverage.  
   - This combination supports dynamic filtering and analysis, such as isolating breaking news (early mentions close to **DATEADDED**) versus retrospective or anniversary coverage (mentions occurring long after **DATEADDED**).

4. **Enabling Dynamic Filtering and Confidence-Based Selection**:  
   - The Mentions table’s confidence scores, combined with the precise timing from **DATEADDED**, allow users to filter events and mentions to suit specific analytical needs—whether focusing on earliest reports, most reliable mentions, or broad media coverage patterns.  
   - This enhances the ability to manage the temporal resolution of event data while simultaneously understanding the networked structure of how events are reported and discussed globally.

**In summary**, the **DATEADDED** field anchors each event in time with high precision, enabling fine-grained temporal analysis, while the **Mentions** table captures the complex network of media references to that event over time. Together, they provide a powerful framework for managing both the temporal resolution and the network structure of news events in GDELT 2.0, facilitating detailed tracking, filtering, and analysis of event trajectories through the global media landscape.","['THE GDELT EVENT DATABASE \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.0 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their \ndescriptions.  GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, \ncapturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2.  A wide array of variables break \nout the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, \nthe Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique \narray of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both \nactors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the \nstory of each event “in flight” through the global media system. \n \nAt present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, \nhowever in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 \nformat.  The   Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note \nthat files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited).   \n \nWith the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at \nleast through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without \nmodification.  Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning \nFebruary 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches \nback to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. \n  \nThere are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset.  The first is the \ntraditional Event table.  This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several \nchanges as noted below.  In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records \nall mentions of each event.  As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those \nmentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, \nincluding the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus \nbeing buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event \nfrom that specific news report.  The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it \npossible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases.  Those wishing to find the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of \nperiod “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest \nevents with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the \nhighest Confidence measures.  This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each \nindividual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below).  It also makes it possible to \nidentify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those \nwith the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific \nsource language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).'
 'Finally, a set of fields at the end of the record provide additional data management information for the \nevent record.   \n \n\uf0b7 \nDATEADDED. (integer) This field stores the date the event was added to the master database \nin YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format in the UTC timezone.  For those needing to access events at 15 \nminute resolution, this is the field that should be used in queries. \n\uf0b7 \nSOURCEURL.  (string) This field records the URL or citation of the first news report it found this \nevent in.  In most cases this is the first report it saw the article in, but due to the timing and \nflow of news reports through the processing pipeline, this may not always be the very first \nreport, but is at least in the first few reports. \n \n \n \nMENTIONS TABLE \n \nThe Mentions table is a new addition to GDELT 2.0 and records each mention of the events in the Event \ntable, making it possible to track the trajectory and network structure of a story as it flows through the \nglobal media system.  Each mention of an event receives its own entry in the Mentions table – thus an \nevent which is mentioned in 100 articles will be listed 100 times in the Mentions table.  Mentions are \nrecorded irrespective of the date of the original event, meaning that a mention today of an event from a \nyear ago will still be recorded, making it possible to trace discussion of “anniversary events” or historical \nevents being recontextualized into present actions.  If a news report mentions multiple events, each \nmention is recorded separately in this table.  For translated documents, all measures below are based \non its English translation. \n \nSeveral of the new measures recorded in the Mentions table make it possible to better filter events \nbased on how confident GDELT was in its extraction of that event.  When trying to understand news \nmedia spanning the entire globe, one finds that journalism is rife with ambiguities, assumed background \nknowledge, and complex linguistic structures.  Not every event mention will take the form of “American \nPresident Barack Obama met with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday at a trade summit in Paris, \nFrance.”  Instead, an event mention might more commonly appear as “Obama and Putin were in Paris \nyesterday for a trade summit.  The two leaders met backstage where he discussed his policy on \nUkraine.”  To which of the two leader(s) do “he” and “his” refer?  Is Obama discussing Obama’s policy on \nUkraine, or is Obama discussing Putin’s policy on Ukraine, or is it Putin discussing Putin’s policy or \nperhaps Putin discussing Obama’s policy?  While additional cues may be available in the surrounding \ntext, ambiguous event mentions like this are exceptionally common across the world’s media.  Similarly, \nit would be difficult indeed to maintain an exhaustive list of every single political figure in the entire \nworld and thus context is often critical for disambiguating the geographic affiliation of an actor.  Even in \nthe case of more senior political leadership, a reference to “Renauld’s press conference this afternoon in \nPort-au-Prince” most likely refers to Lener Renauld, the Minister of Defense of Haiti, but this \ndisambiguation still carries with it some degree of ambiguity.  GDELT makes use of an array of natural \nlanguage processing algorithms like coreference and deep parsing using whole-of-document context.  \nWhile these enormously increase GDELT’s ability to understand and extract ambiguous and linguistically \ncomplex events, such extractions also come with a higher potential for error.  Under GDELT 1.0, the \nNumMentions field as designed as a composite score of the absolute number of unique documents \nmentioning an event and the number of revisions to the text required by these various algorithms, up to \nsix revision passes.  Under GDELT 2.0, the Mentions table now separates these, with each record in the \nMentions table recording an individual mention of an event in an article, while the new Confidence field'
 'records GDELT’s confidence in its extraction of that event from that particular article.  This field is a \npercent, ranging from 10 to 100% and indicates how aggressively GDELT had to perform tasks like \ncoreference or grammatical restructuring to extract the event from that article.  Sorting all mentions of \nan event by this field makes it possible to identify articles featuring the strongest and most \nunambiguous discussion of an event. \n \n\uf0b7 \nGlobalEventID.  (integer)  This is the ID of the event that was mentioned in the article. \n\uf0b7 \nEventTimeDate.  (integer)  This is the 15-minute timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) when the \nevent being mentioned was first recorded by GDELT (the DATEADDED field of the original event \nrecord).  This field can be compared against the next one to identify events being mentioned for \nthe first time (their first mentions) or to identify events of a particular vintage being mentioned \nnow (such as filtering for mentions of events at least one week old). \n\uf0b7 \nMentionTimeDate.  (integer)  This is the 15-minute timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) of the \ncurrent update.  This is identical for all entries in the update file but is included to make it easier \nto load the Mentions table into a database.   \n\uf0b7 \nMentionType.  (integer)  This is a numeric identifier that refers to the source collection the \ndocument came from and is used to interpret the MentionIdentifier in the next column.  In \nessence, it specifies how to interpret the MentionIdentifier to locate the actual document.  At \npresent, it can hold one of the following values: \no 1 = WEB (The document originates from the open web and the MentionIdentifier is a \nfully-qualified URL that can be used to access the document on the web). \no 2 = CITATIONONLY (The document originates from a broadcast, print, or other offline \nsource in which only a textual citation is available for the document.  In this case the \nMentionIdentifier contains the textual citation for the document). \no 3 = CORE (The document originates from the CORE archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through the CORE \nwebsite). \no 4 = DTIC (The document originates from the DTIC archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through the DTIC website). \no 5 = JSTOR (The document originates from the JSTOR archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through your JSTOR \nsubscription if your institution subscribes to it). \no 6 = NONTEXTUALSOURCE (The document originates from a textual proxy (such as closed \ncaptioning) of a non-textual information source (such as a video) available via a URL and \nthe MentionIdentifier provides the URL of the non-textual original source.  At present, \nthis Collection Identifier is used for processing of the closed captioning streams of the \nInternet Archive Television News Archive in which each broadcast is available via a URL, \nbut the URL offers access only to the video of the broadcast and does not provide any \naccess to the textual closed captioning used to generate the metadata.  This code is \nused in order to draw a distinction between URL-based textual material (Collection \nIdentifier 1 (WEB) and URL-based non-textual material like the Television News Archive). \n\uf0b7 \nMentionSourceName.  (integer)  This is a human-friendly identifier of the source of the \ndocument.  For material originating from the open web with a URL this field will contain the top-\nlevel domain the page was from.  For BBC Monitoring material it will contain “BBC Monitoring” \nand for JSTOR material it will contain “JSTOR.”  This field is intended for human display of major \nsources as well as for network analysis of information flows by source, obviating the \nrequirement to perform domain or other parsing of the MentionIdentifier field.'
 'EVENT TABLE \n \nEVENTID AND DATE ATTRIBUTES \n \nThe first few fields of an event record capture its globally unique identifier number, the date the event \ntook place on, and several alternatively formatted versions of the date designed to make it easier to \nwork with the event records in different analytical software programs that may have specific date \nformat requirements.  The parenthetical after each variable name gives the datatype of that field. \n \nNote that even though GDELT 2.0 operates at a 15 minute resolution, the date fields in this section still \nrecord the date at the daily level, since this is the resolution that event analysis has historically been \nperformed at.  To examine events at the 15 minute resolution, use the DATEADDED field (the second \nfrom the last field in this table at the end).  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGlobalEventID.  (integer) Globally unique identifier assigned to each event record that uniquely \nidentifies it in the master dataset.  NOTE: While these will often be sequential with date, this is \nNOT always the case and this field should NOT be used to sort events by date: the date fields \nshould be used for this.  NOTE: There is a large gap in the sequence between February 18, 2015 \nand February 19, 2015 with the switchover to GDELT 2.0 – these are not missing events, the ID \nsequence was simply reset at a higher number so that it is possible to easily distinguish events \ncreated after the switchover to GDELT 2.0 from those created using the older GDELT 1.0 system. \n\uf0b7 \nDay.  (integer) Date the event took place in YYYYMMDD format.  See DATEADDED field for \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS date. \n\uf0b7 \nMonthYear.  (integer) Alternative formatting of the event date, in YYYYMM format. \n\uf0b7 \nYear.  (integer) Alternative formatting of the event date, in YYYY format. \n\uf0b7 \nFractionDate.  (floating point) Alternative formatting of the event date, computed as YYYY.FFFF, \nwhere FFFF is the percentage of the year completed by that day.  This collapses the month and \nday into a fractional range from 0 to 0.9999, capturing the 365 days of the year.  The fractional \ncomponent (FFFF) is computed as (MONTH * 30 + DAY) / 365.  This is an approximation and does \nnot correctly take into account the differing numbers of days in each month or leap years, but \noffers a simple single-number sorting mechanism for applications that wish to estimate the \nrough temporal distance between dates. \n \n \nACTOR ATTRIBUTES \n \nThe next fields describe attributes and characteristics of the two actors involved in the event.  This \nincludes the complete raw CAMEO code for each actor, its proper name, and associated attributes.  The \nraw CAMEO code for each actor contains an array of coded attributes indicating geographic, ethnic, and \nreligious affiliation and the actor’s role in the environment (political elite, military officer, rebel, etc).  \nThese 3-character codes may be combined in any order and are concatenated together to form the final \nraw actor CAMEO code.  To make it easier to utilize this information in analysis, this section breaks these \ncodes out into a set of individual fields that can be separately queried.  NOTE: all attributes in this \nsection other than CountryCode are derived from the TABARI ACTORS dictionary and are NOT \nsupplemented from information in the text.  Thus, if the text refers to a group as “Radicalized'
 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.'
 '2\nConstructing a Knowledge Graph for GDELT\nAs previously mentioned, while the GDELT-GKG2 dataset is not actually natively in the form of a knowledge\ngraph, it is advertised and frequently cited as being one. We believe that we are making a distinct contribution\nto the research community by converting the very popular GKG2 database into a proper KG.\nGKG2 is natively a database of three related tables:\n• expert.csv captures event information;\n• GKG.csv captures article information; and\n• mentions.csv relates which articles mention which events.\nFigure 2: GDELT GKG 2.0 schema relating articles (GKG), mentions, and events (Export).\nThe database schema for these three CSV files is shown in Fig. 2 (see also [9]). The key characteristics of\nthis database relational schema should be interpreted as follows:\n• The three tables are color-coded by Events (green), Mentions (pink), and Articles (blue).\n• The single table of Events is shown in multiple green sub-tables, simply for clarity and convenience to\nlayout a long record structure.\n• Single-headed arrows represent one-to-many relationships between the tables. Specifically:\n– Each Event maps to multiple Mentions via the shared GLOBALEVENTID field.\n– Each Article maps to multiple Mentions via the DocumentIdentifer field on the Article side\nmatching to the MentionIdentifier field on the Mention side.\n• In this way, the Mentions table acts as a “pairs file” recording a many-many relation between Events\nand Articles: each event can be mentioned in multiple articles, and dually each article can men-\ntion many events. Each Article also has both a unique identifier through the GKGRECORDID or the\nDocumentIdentifer fields, since each row in the GKG data represents a single article.\n3'
 '• Solid edges indicate a field in a relational table and are labeled with the type of semantic relation.\n• Dashed and bold edges indicate the structural, one-to-many relations in the relational schema.\nThe naming convention also captures the unique identifier for these csv files, so that ⟨GLOBALEVENTID⟩\nidentifies unique Events, the pair (⟨GLOBALEVENTID⟩, ⟨MentionIdentifier⟩) identifies unique Mentions, as\ndoes ⟨DocumentIdentifier⟩for Articles. We again note that the document and mention identifiers are the\nsame field, but have different field names (e.g., a URL is typically used for the document identifier and the\nsame URL is used for the mention identifier).\n3\nCase Study - Baltimore Bridge Collapse\nHere we will provide an analysis of data collected over a recent and short period of time to do question-\nanswering based analysis. The point of collecting recent data is that the LLMs used have not yet been\ntrained on these events (at the time of this study) and thus the knowledge systems are needed to supply\nthe LLM with relevant information. Specifically, this analysis uses a subset of the GDELT data collected\non March 26th of 2024 from 12:00 AM to 10:00 AM during and after the collapse of the Francis Scott Key\nBridge in Baltimore, Maryland, which occurred at approximately 1:29 AM. This 10 hour window of time\ncaptures the media response to this disaster. We filtered down the collected mentions data to only include\nrows in any of the related data if it included any of the keywords “Baltimore”, “bridge”, “collapse”, or\n“ship”. We then used all GLOBALEVENTIDs and MentionIdentifiers in this reduced mentions file to collect\nthe relevant events and articles. This filtration resulted in using approximately 1.33% of the available data\nwith 371 events, 2047 mentions, and 209 articles.\n3.1\nGDELT Knowledge Graphs\nUsing the GDELT data directly and the scraped text we can construct a total of three KGs:\nDirect KG (DKG): The first KG was simply a direct conversion of the subset of the original GDELT data\ninto an equivalent KG as specified by our ontology in Fig. 3. This KG is shown in Fig. 4a.\nLlamaIndex KG (LKG): The second KG was generated by an LLM deployed against a text corpus con-\nsisting of the source articles collected by scraping URLs of the 209 articles included in our GDELT\nsubset, and enriched with knowledge of the ontology. This KG is shown in Fig. 4b.\nGraphRAG KG (GRKG): The final KG was generated using the same articles as the LKG, using Mi-\ncrosoft’s open-source GraphRAG package with default configuration parameters. This KG is shown in\nFig. 4c.\nThe example KG constructed using our ontology (DKG) is shown in a reduced form in Fig. 4a. The nodes\nare color coded based on their source. Note that node and edge labels are not shown in order to facilitate\nclarity. This KG is one component and has 3,469 nodes and 18,052 edges.\nTo construct a KG directly from the corpus of source document text (LKG) shown in Fig. 4b, we used\nMixtral-8x7B [11] as our base model, following the procedure outlined by the LlamaIndex package developers\n[1]. The LLM is prompted to extract triples from the news articles according to a prompt provided in the\nparameter kg triplet prompt. Using the default prompt, the ontology does not get incorporated and the\nresulting KG is a star-shaped graph with a single central node and all other nodes connected to this center,\nthere being no other edges. When we change the prompt to consider the entire ontology, we again get a\nstar-shaped graph. Nontrivial graph structure arose when we prompted the language model with a reduced\nversion of the ontology with adaptation for unstructured text. In particular, our prompt asked for:\n• Vertices of one of the following types: “Event”, “Article”, “Mention”, “Person”, “Quotation”, “Orga-\nnization”, “Location”, and “Other”, with the last type serving as a catch-all.\n5']"
"What limitations did the previous GKG system have in associating contextual details, and how do the unique record identifiers introduced in GKG 2.1 improve the management and referencing of GKG records?","['<1-hop>\n\nof contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and events driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context. However, with the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together. For example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all appeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in that article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, but there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional roles. GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference to an object in the original article. While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new field allows for simple proximity-based contextualization. In the case of the example article above, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry than to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to the others. In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other connectivity can be explored. Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity indicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and geographic affiliations. \uf0b7 Over 100 New GKG Themes. There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating oil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social issues like marginalization and burning in effigy. The list of recognized infectious diseases, ethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 global humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global currencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking species migration and poaching. \uf0b7 Extensible XML Block. GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for its source material. Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage across the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures. As GDELT encodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and government reports, additional types of information are available to codify. As a first example of this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion words of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and the Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East. Academic literature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the papers cited within that paper. This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation graphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts. Yet, such citation lists are unique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it would be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these kinds of specialized data types. Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called V2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are applicable only to subsets of the collection. Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode highly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \uf0b7'
 '<2-hop>\n\nUnique Record Identifiers. To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event Database, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier. As with the event database, sequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a record across the entire collection. The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will make it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. 1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html']","The previous GKG system had difficulty associating various data points together, such as linking people, organizations, locations, and their functional roles within the same article. For example, while it could record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin appeared in an article along with the United States and Russia and roles like President and Secretary of State, it could not associate each person with the corresponding location and role. GKG 2.1 addresses this limitation by providing approximate character offsets for each reference, enabling proximity-based contextualization to better recover functional, thematic, and geographic affiliations. Additionally, GKG 2.1 introduces unique record identifiers for every GKG record, aligning with the GDELT Event Database practices. These unique identifiers allow each record to be distinctly referenced across the entire collection, improving the management and precise referencing of GKG records.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer,"The previous GKG system had significant limitations in associating contextual details because it could only record the presence of various entities (people, organizations, locations, roles, events) within an article but could not link these entities together in a meaningful way. For example, while it could note that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all appeared in the same article along with mentions of the United States, Russia, and roles like President and Secretary of State, it could not associate each person with their corresponding location or functional role. This lack of association made it difficult to understand the relationships and contextual connections between entities within the text.

GKG 2.1 improves this situation by introducing the approximate character offset of each reference to an object in the original article. Although this does not provide deep semantic associations, it enables simple proximity-based contextualization. For instance, mentions of the United States are likely to occur closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry than to Vladimir Putin, and the role ""Secretary of State"" is likely closer to John Kerry than to the others. This proximity information allows users to explore critical contextual connections such as roles, geographic associations, and thematic affiliations more effectively.

Additionally, GKG 2.1 introduces unique record identifiers (GKGRECORDID) for every GKG record. These identifiers are globally unique strings that encode the date and time of the update batch and a sequential number within that batch (e.g., ""20150203033000-5""). Records from translated documents include a ""T"" to distinguish language origin (e.g., ""20150203033000-T5""). The unique identifiers improve the management and referencing of GKG records by:

- Allowing each record to be uniquely identified across the entire GKG database.
- Facilitating easier referencing and filtering of specific records.
- Enabling better provenance tracking, especially important with the inclusion of translated documents.
- Aligning GKG record management practices with those used in the GDELT Event Database.

In summary, the previous GKG system's limitation was the inability to associate entities contextually within articles, while GKG 2.1's introduction of character offsets enables proximity-based contextualization. The addition of unique record identifiers enhances record management, referencing, and provenance tracking across the GKG dataset.","['of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html'
 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.'
 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but'
 '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,'

For all\nother questions, the language model cannot answer the posed questions by itself due to the recency of the\nbridge collapse.\nTo quantitatively evaluate the quality of the answers generated by our different question-answering methods,\nwe require a set of ground truth answers for the questions posed.

These ground truth answers serve as the benchmark against which the performance of each system is\nmeasured.\nQuestion\nGround Truth\nWhat is the name of the Bridge that collapsed and\nwhat river was it on?\nThe Francis Scott Key Bridge on the Patapsco River.\nWhat is the name of the ship that collided with the\nbaltimore bridge?\nThe ship was named the Dali.\nHow many articles did CNN publish about the Bal-\ntimore bridge collapse?\nCNN published 5 articles.\nOn what date did the Baltimore Bridge collapse?\nThe collapse occurred on March 26, 2024.\nWho is Brandon Scott?\nBrandon Scott is the Mayor of Baltimore.\nWho is Niki Fennoy?\nNiki Fennoy is a city police spokesman.\nWhat are the top themes present in the data?\nThemes include maritime incidents, manmade disaster, and\nwater-related topics.\nTable 2: Ground Truth Answers for the Baltimore Bridge Collapse Questions\nTo further validate our qualitative findings, Figure 5 presents a quantitative comparison of the semantic\nsimilarity of answers generated by the five different methods when querying the GDELT dataset related\nto the Baltimore bridge collapse. We compute the quality of the result by calculating cosine similarity5, a\nmeasure of the similarity between the embeddings of the predicted answer and the ground truth, with higher\nvalues indicating greater accuracy. The box plots illustrate the distribution of these similarity scores for each\nmethod: Graph Query on DKG, G-Retriever on DKG, RAG using Vector Store, G-Retriever on LKG, and\nGraphRAG Q&A on GRKG. As our qualitative analysis suggested, methods leveraging direct graph queries\non the DKG, standard RAG with a vector store, and GraphRAG Q&A on the GRKG generally exhibit the\nhighest cosine similarity scores, providing quantitative evidence for their superior performance in generating\naccurate and relevant answers compared to the G-Retriever, especially with the LKG. This visualization\nquantitatively confirms the trends observed in the qualitative evaluation presented in Table 1.\n4\nConclusion\nThis work has taken the GDELT GKG database and introduced an ontology to create a knowledge graph\nwith rich structure. We found that while the large KG produced by the GDELT-GKG2 database has rich\ninformation for question-answering, the ad hoc techniques for graph exploration deem further investigation\nfor reliable use. That said, the information stored in the KG produced here is not without flaws, and we\nexpect the example studied here to be useful for the broader synergy between KGs and LLMs as addressed\nby others [18]. While the KGs produced using LlamaIndex captured a summary of the events surrounding\nthe Baltimore bridge collapse, the quality of the resulting structure was not suitable for question-answering.\nThose techniques incorporated into the GraphRAG package did considerably better, but there is room for\nimprovement for answering global questions, resolving duplicate entities, and incorporating ontologically-\nguided relation extraction. We believe the incorporation of the ontology into the relation extraction will\nhave the benefit of allowing tools such as GraphRAG to better answer quantitative questions that only the\nontology based KG pipeline (DKG) was able to answer (e.g., the number of articles published on a topic).\nLarge language models continue to be adapted to solve problems across domains, and the case study on the\nKG built here presents much opportunity for future development. In particular, the debate around using\n5The\nsemantic\nembeddings\nused\nto\ncalculate\nthe\ncosine\nsimilarity\nwere\ngenerated\nusing\nthe\nsentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from the Sentence Transformers library.\n9'
 '2\nConstructing a Knowledge Graph for GDELT\nAs previously mentioned, while the GDELT-GKG2 dataset is not actually natively in the form of a knowledge\ngraph, it is advertised and frequently cited as being one. We believe that we are making a distinct contribution\nto the research community by converting the very popular GKG2 database into a proper KG.\nGKG2 is natively a database of three related tables:\n• expert.csv captures event information;\n• GKG.csv captures article information; and\n• mentions.csv relates which articles mention which events.\nFigure 2: GDELT GKG 2.0 schema relating articles (GKG), mentions, and events (Export).\nThe database schema for these three CSV files is shown in Fig. 2 (see also [9]). The key characteristics of\nthis database relational schema should be interpreted as follows:\n• The three tables are color-coded by Events (green), Mentions (pink), and Articles (blue).\n• The single table of Events is shown in multiple green sub-tables, simply for clarity and convenience to\nlayout a long record structure.\n• Single-headed arrows represent one-to-many relationships between the tables. Specifically:\n– Each Event maps to multiple Mentions via the shared GLOBALEVENTID field.\n– Each Article maps to multiple Mentions via the DocumentIdentifer field on the Article side\nmatching to the MentionIdentifier field on the Mention side.\n• In this way, the Mentions table acts as a “pairs file” recording a many-many relation between Events\nand Articles: each event can be mentioned in multiple articles, and dually each article can men-\ntion many events. Each Article also has both a unique identifier through the GKGRECORDID or the\nDocumentIdentifer fields, since each row in the GKG data represents a single article.\n3'

How does the GDELT system use sentiment analysis and date mentions to identify anniversary violence indicators?,"['<1-hop>\n\nadds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening entirely new analytic opportunities. Some of the most significant changes: \uf0b7 Realtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes. The GDELT Global Content Analysis Measures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment analysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual dimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, French, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Urdu). GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents and reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from LIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \uf0b7 Realtime Translation of 65 Languages. GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT Translingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine translation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, representing 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into English for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines. GDELT Translingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the very first glimpses of a world without language barriers. The GKG system now processes every news report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \uf0b7 Relevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds. A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now specify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that represents the core focus of the article. GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats including Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats. In addition, GDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to identify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded social media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is compiled. This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations anywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act as a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \uf0b7 Quotes, Names, and Amounts. The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food prices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable item. GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to offer numeric context to global events. In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing Person and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, such as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World Cup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran Nuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.

1. **Sentiment Analysis via GCAM Module**:  
   - GDELT’s Global Content Analysis Measures (GCAM) module performs real-time sentiment analysis on every news article it processes.  
   - It integrates 24 emotional measurement packages that collectively assess over 2,300 emotions and themes, including emotions like anxiety, positivity, smugness, and passivity.  
   - This multilingual sentiment analysis covers 15 languages natively and is applied to all translated content (translated from 65 languages into English).  
   - By measuring the emotional undercurrents and reactions in news articles, GDELT can detect emotional patterns that may signal tensions or violence.

2. **Extraction of Date Mentions**:  
   - GDELT extracts all day, month, and year date references mentioned within news articles and documents.  
   - This extraction allows the system to identify repeated mentions of specific dates, which can be indicative of anniversaries.  
   - The system specifically encodes these date references to track when events or historical incidents are being recalled or discussed again in the media.

3. **Linking Sentiment and Date Mentions to Identify Anniversary Violence**:  
   - By combining the emotional tone detected through sentiment analysis with the presence of specific date mentions, GDELT can identify when news coverage is revisiting past violent events on their anniversaries.  
   - The Mentions table records each mention of an event, including those that occur long after the original event date, enabling the tracing of anniversary discussions or recontextualizations of historical violence.  
   - This capability helps to flag potential ""anniversary violence"" indicators, where heightened emotional content and repeated date mentions coincide, signaling possible renewed tensions or outbreaks of violence linked to past events.

In summary, GDELT uses its advanced, multilingual sentiment analysis to gauge emotional content in news articles and extracts explicit date mentions to detect repeated references to specific dates. The intersection of these two data streams enables the system to identify indicators of anniversary violence by recognizing when emotionally charged media coverage revisits past violent events on their anniversaries.","['adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening \nentirely new analytic opportunities.  Some of the most significant changes: \n \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes.  The GDELT Global Content Analysis \nMeasures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment \nanalysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together \nassess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual \ndimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, \nFrench, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and \nUrdu).  GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents \nand reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from \nLIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Translation of 65 Languages.  GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n\uf0b7 \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.  A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now \nspecify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that \nrepresents the core focus of the article.  GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.  This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations \nanywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act \nas a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \n\uf0b7 \nQuotes, Names, and Amounts.  The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food \nprices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable \nitem.  GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to \noffer numeric context to global events.  In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing \nPerson and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, \nsuch as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World \nCup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran \nNuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n\uf0b7 \nDate Mentions.  We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references \nfound in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates \nas possible “anniversary violence” indicators.  All day, month, and year dates are now extracted \nfrom each document. \n\uf0b7 \nProximity Context.  Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the \nintroduction of the new Proximity Context capability.  The GKG records an enormously rich array'
 'Finally, a set of fields at the end of the record provide additional data management information for the \nevent record.   \n \n\uf0b7 \nDATEADDED. (integer) This field stores the date the event was added to the master database \nin YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format in the UTC timezone.  For those needing to access events at 15 \nminute resolution, this is the field that should be used in queries. \n\uf0b7 \nSOURCEURL.  (string) This field records the URL or citation of the first news report it found this \nevent in.  In most cases this is the first report it saw the article in, but due to the timing and \nflow of news reports through the processing pipeline, this may not always be the very first \nreport, but is at least in the first few reports. \n \n \n \nMENTIONS TABLE \n \nThe Mentions table is a new addition to GDELT 2.0 and records each mention of the events in the Event \ntable, making it possible to track the trajectory and network structure of a story as it flows through the \nglobal media system.  Each mention of an event receives its own entry in the Mentions table – thus an \nevent which is mentioned in 100 articles will be listed 100 times in the Mentions table.  Mentions are \nrecorded irrespective of the date of the original event, meaning that a mention today of an event from a \nyear ago will still be recorded, making it possible to trace discussion of “anniversary events” or historical \nevents being recontextualized into present actions.  If a news report mentions multiple events, each \nmention is recorded separately in this table.  For translated documents, all measures below are based \non its English translation. \n \nSeveral of the new measures recorded in the Mentions table make it possible to better filter events \nbased on how confident GDELT was in its extraction of that event.  When trying to understand news \nmedia spanning the entire globe, one finds that journalism is rife with ambiguities, assumed background \nknowledge, and complex linguistic structures.  Not every event mention will take the form of “American \nPresident Barack Obama met with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday at a trade summit in Paris, \nFrance.”  Instead, an event mention might more commonly appear as “Obama and Putin were in Paris \nyesterday for a trade summit.  The two leaders met backstage where he discussed his policy on \nUkraine.”  To which of the two leader(s) do “he” and “his” refer?  Is Obama discussing Obama’s policy on \nUkraine, or is Obama discussing Putin’s policy on Ukraine, or is it Putin discussing Putin’s policy or \nperhaps Putin discussing Obama’s policy?  While additional cues may be available in the surrounding \ntext, ambiguous event mentions like this are exceptionally common across the world’s media.  Similarly, \nit would be difficult indeed to maintain an exhaustive list of every single political figure in the entire \nworld and thus context is often critical for disambiguating the geographic affiliation of an actor.  Even in \nthe case of more senior political leadership, a reference to “Renauld’s press conference this afternoon in \nPort-au-Prince” most likely refers to Lener Renauld, the Minister of Defense of Haiti, but this \ndisambiguation still carries with it some degree of ambiguity.  GDELT makes use of an array of natural \nlanguage processing algorithms like coreference and deep parsing using whole-of-document context.  \nWhile these enormously increase GDELT’s ability to understand and extract ambiguous and linguistically \ncomplex events, such extractions also come with a higher potential for error.  Under GDELT 1.0, the \nNumMentions field as designed as a composite score of the absolute number of unique documents \nmentioning an event and the number of revisions to the text required by these various algorithms, up to \nsix revision passes.  Under GDELT 2.0, the Mentions table now separates these, with each record in the \nMentions table recording an individual mention of an event in an article, while the new Confidence field'
 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.'

 '• Solid edges indicate a field in a relational table and are labeled with the type of semantic relation.\n• Dashed and bold edges indicate the structural, one-to-many relations in the relational schema.\nThe naming convention also captures the unique identifier for these csv files, so that ⟨GLOBALEVENTID⟩\nidentifies unique Events, the pair (⟨GLOBALEVENTID⟩, ⟨MentionIdentifier⟩) identifies unique Mentions, as\ndoes ⟨DocumentIdentifier⟩for Articles. We again note that the document and mention identifiers are the\nsame field, but have different field names (e.g., a URL is typically used for the document identifier and the\nsame URL is used for the mention identifier).\n3\nCase Study - Baltimore Bridge Collapse\nHere we will provide an analysis of data collected over a recent and short period of time to do question-\nanswering based analysis. The point of collecting recent data is that the LLMs used have not yet been\ntrained on these events (at the time of this study) and thus the knowledge systems are needed to supply\nthe LLM with relevant information. Specifically, this analysis uses a subset of the GDELT data collected\non March 26th of 2024 from 12:00 AM to 10:00 AM during and after the collapse of the Francis Scott Key\nBridge in Baltimore, Maryland, which occurred at approximately 1:29 AM. This 10 hour window of time\ncaptures the media response to this disaster. We filtered down the collected mentions data to only include\nrows in any of the related data if it included any of the keywords “Baltimore”, “bridge”, “collapse”, or\n“ship”. We then used all GLOBALEVENTIDs and MentionIdentifiers in this reduced mentions file to collect\nthe relevant events and articles. This filtration resulted in using approximately 1.33% of the available data\nwith 371 events, 2047 mentions, and 209 articles.\n3.1\nGDELT Knowledge Graphs\nUsing the GDELT data directly and the scraped text we can construct a total of three KGs:\nDirect KG (DKG): The first KG was simply a direct conversion of the subset of the original GDELT data\ninto an equivalent KG as specified by our ontology in Fig. 3. This KG is shown in Fig. 4a.\nLlamaIndex KG (LKG): The second KG was generated by an LLM deployed against a text corpus con-\nsisting of the source articles collected by scraping URLs of the 209 articles included in our GDELT\nsubset, and enriched with knowledge of the ontology. This KG is shown in Fig. 4b.\nGraphRAG KG (GRKG): The final KG was generated using the same articles as the LKG, using Mi-\ncrosoft’s open-source GraphRAG package with default configuration parameters. This KG is shown in\nFig. 4c.\nThe example KG constructed using our ontology (DKG) is shown in a reduced form in Fig. 4a. The nodes\nare color coded based on their source. Note that node and edge labels are not shown in order to facilitate\nclarity. This KG is one component and has 3,469 nodes and 18,052 edges.\nTo construct a KG directly from the corpus of source document text (LKG) shown in Fig. 4b, we used\nMixtral-8x7B [11] as our base model, following the procedure outlined by the LlamaIndex package developers\n[1]. The LLM is prompted to extract triples from the news articles according to a prompt provided in the\nparameter kg triplet prompt. Using the default prompt, the ontology does not get incorporated and the\nresulting KG is a star-shaped graph with a single central node and all other nodes connected to this center,\nthere being no other edges. When we change the prompt to consider the entire ontology, we again get a\nstar-shaped graph. Nontrivial graph structure arose when we prompted the language model with a reduced\nversion of the ontology with adaptation for unstructured text. In particular, our prompt asked for:\n• Vertices of one of the following types: “Event”, “Article”, “Mention”, “Person”, “Quotation”, “Orga-\nnization”, “Location”, and “Other”, with the last type serving as a catch-all.\n5'
 'THE GDELT EVENT DATABASE \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.0 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their \ndescriptions.  GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, \ncapturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2.  A wide array of variables break \nout the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, \nthe Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique \narray of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both \nactors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the \nstory of each event “in flight” through the global media system. \n \nAt present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, \nhowever in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 \nformat.  The   Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note \nthat files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited).   \n \nWith the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at \nleast through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without \nmodification.  Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning \nFebruary 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches \nback to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. \n  \nThere are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset.  The first is the \ntraditional Event table.  This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several \nchanges as noted below.  In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records \nall mentions of each event.  As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those \nmentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, \nincluding the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus \nbeing buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event \nfrom that specific news report.  The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it \npossible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases.  Those wishing to find the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of \nperiod “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest \nevents with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the \nhighest Confidence measures.  This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each \nindividual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below).  It also makes it possible to \nidentify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those \nwith the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific \nsource language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).'
 'EVENT TABLE \n \nEVENTID AND DATE ATTRIBUTES \n \nThe first few fields of an event record capture its globally unique identifier number, the date the event \ntook place on, and several alternatively formatted versions of the date designed to make it easier to \nwork with the event records in different analytical software programs that may have specific date \nformat requirements.  The parenthetical after each variable name gives the datatype of that field. \n \nNote that even though GDELT 2.0 operates at a 15 minute resolution, the date fields in this section still \nrecord the date at the daily level, since this is the resolution that event analysis has historically been \nperformed at.  To examine events at the 15 minute resolution, use the DATEADDED field (the second \nfrom the last field in this table at the end).  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGlobalEventID.  (integer) Globally unique identifier assigned to each event record that uniquely \nidentifies it in the master dataset.  NOTE: While these will often be sequential with date, this is \nNOT always the case and this field should NOT be used to sort events by date: the date fields \nshould be used for this.  NOTE: There is a large gap in the sequence between February 18, 2015 \nand February 19, 2015 with the switchover to GDELT 2.0 – these are not missing events, the ID \nsequence was simply reset at a higher number so that it is possible to easily distinguish events \ncreated after the switchover to GDELT 2.0 from those created using the older GDELT 1.0 system. \n\uf0b7 \nDay.  (integer) Date the event took place in YYYYMMDD format.  See DATEADDED field for \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS date. \n\uf0b7 \nMonthYear.  (integer) Alternative formatting of the event date, in YYYYMM format. \n\uf0b7 \nYear.  (integer) Alternative formatting of the event date, in YYYY format. \n\uf0b7 \nFractionDate.  (floating point) Alternative formatting of the event date, computed as YYYY.FFFF, \nwhere FFFF is the percentage of the year completed by that day.  This collapses the month and \nday into a fractional range from 0 to 0.9999, capturing the 365 days of the year.  The fractional \ncomponent (FFFF) is computed as (MONTH * 30 + DAY) / 365.  This is an approximation and does \nnot correctly take into account the differing numbers of days in each month or leap years, but \noffers a simple single-number sorting mechanism for applications that wish to estimate the \nrough temporal distance between dates. \n \n \nACTOR ATTRIBUTES \n \nThe next fields describe attributes and characteristics of the two actors involved in the event.  This \nincludes the complete raw CAMEO code for each actor, its proper name, and associated attributes.  The \nraw CAMEO code for each actor contains an array of coded attributes indicating geographic, ethnic, and \nreligious affiliation and the actor’s role in the environment (political elite, military officer, rebel, etc).  \nThese 3-character codes may be combined in any order and are concatenated together to form the final \nraw actor CAMEO code.  To make it easier to utilize this information in analysis, this section breaks these \ncodes out into a set of individual fields that can be separately queried.  NOTE: all attributes in this \nsection other than CountryCode are derived from the TABARI ACTORS dictionary and are NOT \nsupplemented from information in the text.  Thus, if the text refers to a group as “Radicalized'
 'records GDELT’s confidence in its extraction of that event from that particular article.  This field is a \npercent, ranging from 10 to 100% and indicates how aggressively GDELT had to perform tasks like \ncoreference or grammatical restructuring to extract the event from that article.  Sorting all mentions of \nan event by this field makes it possible to identify articles featuring the strongest and most \nunambiguous discussion of an event. \n \n\uf0b7 \nGlobalEventID.

(integer)  This is the 15-minute timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) when the \nevent being mentioned was first recorded by GDELT (the DATEADDED field of the original event \nrecord).  This field can be compared against the next one to identify events being mentioned for \nthe first time (their first mentions) or to identify events of a particular vintage being mentioned \nnow (such as filtering for mentions of events at least one week old). \n\uf0b7 \nMentionTimeDate.  (integer)  This is the 15-minute timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) of the \ncurrent update.  This is identical for all entries in the update file but is included to make it easier \nto load the Mentions table into a database.   \n\uf0b7 \nMentionType.  (integer)  This is a numeric identifier that refers to the source collection the \ndocument came from and is used to interpret the MentionIdentifier in the next column.  In \nessence, it specifies how to interpret the MentionIdentifier to locate the actual document.  At \npresent, it can hold one of the following values: \no 1 = WEB (The document originates from the open web and the MentionIdentifier is a \nfully-qualified URL that can be used to access the document on the web). \no 2 = CITATIONONLY (The document originates from a broadcast, print, or other offline \nsource in which only a textual citation is available for the document.  In this case the \nMentionIdentifier contains the textual citation for the document). \no 3 = CORE (The document originates from the CORE archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through the CORE \nwebsite). \no 4 = DTIC (The document originates from the DTIC archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through the DTIC website). \no 5 = JSTOR (The document originates from the JSTOR archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through your JSTOR \nsubscription if your institution subscribes to it). \no 6 = NONTEXTUALSOURCE (The document originates from a textual proxy (such as closed \ncaptioning) of a non-textual information source (such as a video) available via a URL and \nthe MentionIdentifier provides the URL of the non-textual original source.  At present, \nthis Collection Identifier is used for processing of the closed captioning streams of the \nInternet Archive Television News Archive in which each broadcast is available via a URL, \nbut the URL offers access only to the video of the broadcast and does not provide any \naccess to the textual closed captioning used to generate the metadata.  This code is \nused in order to draw a distinction between URL-based textual material (Collection \nIdentifier 1 (WEB) and URL-based non-textual material like the Television News Archive). \n\uf0b7 \nMentionSourceName.  (integer)  This is a human-friendly identifier of the source of the \ndocument.  For material originating from the open web with a URL this field will contain the top-\nlevel domain the page was from.  For BBC Monitoring material it will contain “BBC Monitoring” \nand for JSTOR material it will contain “JSTOR.”  This field is intended for human display of major \nsources as well as for network analysis of information flows by source, obviating the \nrequirement to perform domain or other parsing of the MentionIdentifier field.'

"How does the GDELT Event Database structure its event records using the expanded dyadic CAMEO format, and in what way does the introduction of unique record identifiers in the GKG align with the practices of the GDELT Event Database to facilitate advanced data referencing and analysis?","['<1-hop>\n\nINTRODUCTION This codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their descriptions. GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, capturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2. A wide array of variables break out the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, the Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique array of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both actors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the story of each event “in flight” through the global media system. At present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, however in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 format. The Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note that files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited). With the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at least through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without modification. Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning February 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches back to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. There are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset. The first is the traditional Event table. This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several changes as noted below. In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records all mentions of each event. As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those mentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, including the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus being buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event from that specific news report. The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it possible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases. Those wishing to find the earliest glimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of period “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest events with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the highest Confidence measures. This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each individual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below). It also makes it possible to identify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those with the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific source language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).'
 '<2-hop>\n\nUnique Record Identifiers. To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event Database, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier. As with the event database, sequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a record across the entire collection. The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will make it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. 1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html']","The GDELT Event Database structures its event records using an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, which captures two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2.

Additionally, a new Mentions table records the network trajectory of each event as it is mentioned across multiple news reports, including key indicators such as the location of the mention within the article and a Confidence measure that allows dynamic filtering of events based on sensitivity and detail. In alignment with these practices, the GKG (Global Knowledge Graph) now assigns a unique record identifier to every GKG record, similar to the GDELT Event Database.

This alignment enhances the ability to perform advanced data analysis and question-answering by ensuring consistent and unique identification of events and knowledge graph records.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer,"The GDELT Event Database structures its event records using an **expanded dyadic CAMEO format** that captures two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2. Specifically:

- Each event record encodes two actors involved in the event, with their raw CAMEO codes representing geographic, ethnic, religious affiliations, and roles (e.g., political elite, military officer, rebel).
- These raw CAMEO actor codes are broken out into multiple detailed fields to facilitate easier querying and analysis.
- The action performed by Actor1 on Actor2 is encoded using an expanded CAMEO action code hierarchy.
- Additional variables include the Goldstein ranking score (which quantifies the event's impact), and a unique set of georeferencing fields that provide estimated geographic positioning at a landmark-centroid level for both actors and the event location.
- Events are recorded one per line in a tab-delimited format, with a globally unique identifier called **GlobalEventID** assigned to each event record. This identifier uniquely identifies each event across the entire dataset but is not strictly sequential by date.

Regarding the **introduction of unique record identifiers in the GKG (Global Knowledge Graph)** and how this aligns with the GDELT Event Database practices:

- The GKG 2.1 format assigns a **unique identifier to every GKG record**, similar to the GlobalEventID in the Event Database.
- These unique identifiers in the GKG allow for unambiguous referencing of individual records across the entire collection.
- This alignment facilitates advanced data referencing and analysis by enabling direct linking between GKG records (which represent articles and their metadata) and Event records.
- The GKG schema includes three related tables—Events, Mentions, and Articles—where:
  - Each Event is linked to multiple Mentions via the GlobalEventID.
  - Each Article has a unique identifier (GKGRECORDID or DocumentIdentifier).
  - The Mentions table acts as a many-to-many relational bridge between Events and Articles, using these unique identifiers.
- This system of unique identifiers supports complex relational queries, such as filtering mentions of an event by confidence scores or article prominence, and enables constructing detailed knowledge graphs that connect events, articles, and mentions.
- Overall, the introduction of unique record identifiers in the GKG brings it in line with the Event Database’s approach, enhancing the ability to cross-reference, filter, and analyze data across both datasets in a coherent and scalable manner.

In summary, the GDELT Event Database’s use of an expanded dyadic CAMEO format with detailed actor and action coding, combined with globally unique event identifiers, provides a structured and richly detailed event dataset. The GKG’s adoption of unique record identifiers mirrors this approach, enabling integrated, advanced referencing and analysis across the event and knowledge graph data streams.","['THE GDELT EVENT DATABASE \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.0 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their \ndescriptions.

 'of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html'
 '2\nConstructing a Knowledge Graph for GDELT\nAs previously mentioned, while the GDELT-GKG2 dataset is not actually natively in the form of a knowledge\ngraph, it is advertised and frequently cited as being one. We believe that we are making a distinct contribution\nto the research community by converting the very popular GKG2 database into a proper KG.\nGKG2 is natively a database of three related tables:\n• expert.csv captures event information;\n• GKG.csv captures article information; and\n• mentions.csv relates which articles mention which events.\nFigure 2: GDELT GKG 2.0 schema relating articles (GKG), mentions, and events (Export).\nThe database schema for these three CSV files is shown in Fig. 2 (see also [9]). The key characteristics of\nthis database relational schema should be interpreted as follows:\n• The three tables are color-coded by Events (green), Mentions (pink), and Articles (blue).\n• The single table of Events is shown in multiple green sub-tables, simply for clarity and convenience to\nlayout a long record structure.\n• Single-headed arrows represent one-to-many relationships between the tables. Specifically:\n– Each Event maps to multiple Mentions via the shared GLOBALEVENTID field.\n– Each Article maps to multiple Mentions via the DocumentIdentifer field on the Article side\nmatching to the MentionIdentifier field on the Mention side.\n• In this way, the Mentions table acts as a “pairs file” recording a many-many relation between Events\nand Articles: each event can be mentioned in multiple articles, and dually each article can men-\ntion many events. Each Article also has both a unique identifier through the GKGRECORDID or the\nDocumentIdentifer fields, since each row in the GKG data represents a single article.\n3'
 '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,'
 'Figure 3: GDELT GKG 2.0 ontology relating articles and events..\nMethods to automatically determine the graphical form of a relational database are widely known [21]. Most\nnaturally, consider a table T with m rows T[j], 1 ≤j ≤m and n columns T.i, 1 ≤i ≤n. Then each of the\nm rows T[j] is represented as a node in one meta-class labeled by the primary keys. This node then has n\noutgoing edges, each connecting to a node in another meta-class representing the field value T[j].i, and labeled\nby the column name. The resulting “star” bipartite graphs are then linked over shared values, including\nacross multiple tables. This method straightforwardly produces a graph schema consistent with a given\nRDB, which may or may not be of sufficient complexity to warrant the lofty description of “ontology”. In\nour case, such a straightforward approach is mostly warranted, although as we will see additional constraints\nin the event table will argue for a somewhat more specific and idosyncratic graph structure.\nAfter understanding the GDELT database schema, we developed a capability to convert (portions of) the\nGDELT database to a KG using an ontology as a graph typing schema, derived from the above relational\nschema. This is shown in Fig. 3, to be interpreted as follows:\n• Nodes in the ontology indicate the types of nodes possible in the KG.\n• Nodes are color-coded to indicate their source relational table.\n• Fields in ⟨angled brackets⟩indicate the field name in the schema.\n4'
 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but'
 'EVENT TABLE \n \nEVENTID AND DATE ATTRIBUTES \n \nThe first few fields of an event record capture its globally unique identifier number, the date the event \ntook place on, and several alternatively formatted versions of the date designed to make it easier to \nwork with the event records in different analytical software programs that may have specific date \nformat requirements.  The parenthetical after each variable name gives the datatype of that field. \n \nNote that even though GDELT 2.0 operates at a 15 minute resolution, the date fields in this section still \nrecord the date at the daily level, since this is the resolution that event analysis has historically been \nperformed at.  To examine events at the 15 minute resolution, use the DATEADDED field (the second \nfrom the last field in this table at the end).  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGlobalEventID.  (integer) Globally unique identifier assigned to each event record that uniquely \nidentifies it in the master dataset.  NOTE: While these will often be sequential with date, this is \nNOT always the case and this field should NOT be used to sort events by date: the date fields \nshould be used for this.  NOTE: There is a large gap in the sequence between February 18, 2015 \nand February 19, 2015 with the switchover to GDELT 2.0 – these are not missing events, the ID \nsequence was simply reset at a higher number so that it is possible to easily distinguish events \ncreated after the switchover to GDELT 2.0 from those created using the older GDELT 1.0 system. \n\uf0b7 \nDay.  (integer) Date the event took place in YYYYMMDD format.  See DATEADDED field for \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS date. \n\uf0b7 \nMonthYear.  (integer) Alternative formatting of the event date, in YYYYMM format. \n\uf0b7 \nYear.  (integer) Alternative formatting of the event date, in YYYY format. \n\uf0b7 \nFractionDate.  (floating point) Alternative formatting of the event date, computed as YYYY.FFFF, \nwhere FFFF is the percentage of the year completed by that day.  This collapses the month and \nday into a fractional range from 0 to 0.9999, capturing the 365 days of the year.  The fractional \ncomponent (FFFF) is computed as (MONTH * 30 + DAY) / 365.  This is an approximation and does \nnot correctly take into account the differing numbers of days in each month or leap years, but \noffers a simple single-number sorting mechanism for applications that wish to estimate the \nrough temporal distance between dates. \n \n \nACTOR ATTRIBUTES \n \nThe next fields describe attributes and characteristics of the two actors involved in the event.  This \nincludes the complete raw CAMEO code for each actor, its proper name, and associated attributes.  The \nraw CAMEO code for each actor contains an array of coded attributes indicating geographic, ethnic, and \nreligious affiliation and the actor’s role in the environment (political elite, military officer, rebel, etc).  \nThese 3-character codes may be combined in any order and are concatenated together to form the final \nraw actor CAMEO code.  To make it easier to utilize this information in analysis, this section breaks these \ncodes out into a set of individual fields that can be separately queried.

As with the event database, sequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a record across the entire collection. The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will make it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. 1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html']","The introduction of unique record identifiers in the GKG aligns with the practices of the GDELT Event Database by assigning every GKG record a unique identifier, which uniquely identifies a record across the entire collection, similar to the event database. This change facilitates easier and more precise referencing of particular GKG records. Additionally, the GKG data environment is simplified by eliminating the separate counts-only file, consolidating data into a single full GKG file that includes thematic and other data fields to contextualize counts and tie them into the GDELT Event Database. Together, these changes improve data management and usability within the GDELT Event Database framework.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer,"The introduction of unique record identifiers in the GKG (Global Knowledge Graph) aligns closely with the practices of the GDELT Event Database by adopting a similar approach to uniquely identify each record across the entire dataset. Specifically:

- **Alignment with GDELT Event Database Practices:**  
  Like the Event Database, each GKG record is now assigned a globally unique identifier (GKGRECORDID). This identifier is a string formatted as “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX,” where the first part encodes the date and time of the update batch, and the suffix is a sequential number within that batch. This mirrors the Event Database’s use of unique IDs to distinctly identify each event record, although the GKG uses a date-oriented serial number rather than semi-sequential numeric IDs.

- **Impact on Simplifying the GKG Data Environment:**  
  The addition of unique record identifiers simplifies the GKG data environment by making it easier to uniquely reference and manage individual GKG records. This is particularly important because, starting with GKG 2.1, the system no longer clusters multiple articles with identical metadata into a single record (as was done in GKG 1.0). Instead, each article is represented as a separate record, necessitating a reliable way to distinguish each one. The unique identifiers enable precise referencing, linking, and integration of GKG records with other datasets, such as the Event Database and Mentions tables.

  Furthermore, the unique IDs facilitate filtering (e.g., distinguishing translated documents by the presence of a ""T"" in the ID), tracking provenance, and supporting complex analyses that require unambiguous record identification. This enhancement, combined with the elimination of the separate counts-only file (merging counts and full data into a single file), streamlines the data structure and reduces complexity for users, making the GKG easier to work with and integrate into analytic workflows.

**In summary:**  
The introduction of unique record identifiers in the GKG brings its record management in line with the GDELT Event Database’s approach, providing a standardized, unambiguous way to identify each record. This change simplifies the GKG data environment by enabling straightforward referencing, better integration, and more efficient data handling, especially given the shift to representing each article as a distinct record rather than clustering them.","['of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.

 '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,'
 '2\nConstructing a Knowledge Graph for GDELT\nAs previously mentioned, while the GDELT-GKG2 dataset is not actually natively in the form of a knowledge\ngraph, it is advertised and frequently cited as being one. We believe that we are making a distinct contribution\nto the research community by converting the very popular GKG2 database into a proper KG.\nGKG2 is natively a database of three related tables:\n• expert.csv captures event information;\n• GKG.csv captures article information; and\n• mentions.csv relates which articles mention which events.\nFigure 2: GDELT GKG 2.0 schema relating articles (GKG), mentions, and events (Export).\nThe database schema for these three CSV files is shown in Fig. 2 (see also [9]). The key characteristics of\nthis database relational schema should be interpreted as follows:\n• The three tables are color-coded by Events (green), Mentions (pink), and Articles (blue).\n• The single table of Events is shown in multiple green sub-tables, simply for clarity and convenience to\nlayout a long record structure.\n• Single-headed arrows represent one-to-many relationships between the tables. Specifically:\n– Each Event maps to multiple Mentions via the shared GLOBALEVENTID field.\n– Each Article maps to multiple Mentions via the DocumentIdentifer field on the Article side\nmatching to the MentionIdentifier field on the Mention side.\n• In this way, the Mentions table acts as a “pairs file” recording a many-many relation between Events\nand Articles: each event can be mentioned in multiple articles, and dually each article can men-\ntion many events. Each Article also has both a unique identifier through the GKGRECORDID or the\nDocumentIdentifer fields, since each row in the GKG data represents a single article.\n3'
 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.'
 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but'

When we change the prompt to consider the entire ontology, we again get a\nstar-shaped graph. Nontrivial graph structure arose when we prompted the language model with a reduced\nversion of the ontology with adaptation for unstructured text. In particular, our prompt asked for:\n• Vertices of one of the following types: “Event”, “Article”, “Mention”, “Person”, “Quotation”, “Orga-\nnization”, “Location”, and “Other”, with the last type serving as a catch-all.\n5'
 'THE GDELT EVENT DATABASE \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.0 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their \ndescriptions.  GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, \ncapturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2.  A wide array of variables break \nout the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, \nthe Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique \narray of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both \nactors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the \nstory of each event “in flight” through the global media system. \n \nAt present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, \nhowever in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 \nformat.  The   Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note \nthat files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited).   \n \nWith the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at \nleast through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without \nmodification.  Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning \nFebruary 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches \nback to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. \n  \nThere are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset.  The first is the \ntraditional Event table.  This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several \nchanges as noted below.  In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records \nall mentions of each event.  As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those \nmentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, \nincluding the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus \nbeing buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event \nfrom that specific news report.  The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it \npossible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases.  Those wishing to find the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of \nperiod “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest \nevents with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the \nhighest Confidence measures.  This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each \nindividual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below).  It also makes it possible to \nidentify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those \nwith the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific \nsource language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).'

Some of the most significant changes: \n \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes.  The GDELT Global Content Analysis \nMeasures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment \nanalysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together \nassess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual \ndimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, \nFrench, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and \nUrdu).  GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents \nand reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from \nLIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Translation of 65 Languages.  GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n\uf0b7 \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.  A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now \nspecify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that \nrepresents the core focus of the article.  GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.

 '<2-hop>\n\nINTRODUCTION This codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands GDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards actually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news. It applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to compute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document. To sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening around the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every single day. It has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system on November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an incredible number and diversity of fields. The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent dimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly unimaginable new applications. We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and capabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we are both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original alpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. Due to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create a raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of software packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely complex analytic needs in a single file. Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for direct import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated preprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to extract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package. Thus, users may require more advanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance may be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and network and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook. Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, or other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and size (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in these formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file format needed. The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab- delimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized streamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG. Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, despite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or “.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. The new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards compatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but']","The introduction of the Proximity Context capability in GKG Version 2.1 represents the greatest change from version 1.0, enhancing the overall format by providing a richer array of contextual information. While version 1.0 focused on encoding date mentions such as all day, month, and year dates extracted from documents to identify repeating mentions like ""anniversary violence"" indicators, Version 2.1 expands the system's ability to capture latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of global news through sophisticated natural language processing algorithms. Importantly, Version 2.1 preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format to ensure backwards compatibility, and the system continues to generate daily Version 1.0 files in parallel, allowing users to transition smoothly while benefiting from the new features like Proximity Context.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer,"The introduction of the Proximity Context capability in GKG Version 2.1 significantly improves upon the features available in version 1.0 in the following ways, particularly regarding encoding date mentions and maintaining backwards compatibility:

1. **Enhanced Contextual Association via Proximity Context**  
   - In GKG 1.0, while the system recorded entities such as people, organizations, locations, and roles mentioned in an article, it lacked the ability to associate these entities with each other within the text. For example, it could list Barack Obama, John Kerry, Vladimir Putin, the United States, and Russia as mentioned in an article, but could not specify which person was linked to which location or role.  
   - GKG 2.1 introduces the Proximity Context capability, which encodes the approximate character offset of each reference to an object within the original article text. This allows users to infer which entities are mentioned near each other, enabling a form of simple proximity-based contextualization. For instance, it becomes possible to determine that Barack Obama and John Kerry are mentioned closer to the United States and the role of Secretary of State is mentioned closer to John Kerry than to others. This greatly enhances the ability to explore functional, thematic, and geographic affiliations within the news content.

2. **Encoding of Date Mentions**  
   - GKG 2.1 adds the explicit extraction and encoding of all day, month, and year date mentions found within news articles and documents. This feature was introduced in response to user demand to identify repeating mentions of specific dates, such as for detecting “anniversary violence” indicators.  
   - This is an advancement over GKG 1.0, which did not encode such detailed date references within the articles.

3. **Backwards Compatibility and Format Evolution**  
   - GKG 2.1 preserves most of the previous fields from GKG 1.0 in their existing format to maintain backwards compatibility. Users with code designed for GKG 1.0 can adapt to GKG 2.1 with minimal modification.  
   - However, GKG 2.1 also introduces new fields (e.g., Proximity Context offsets, unique record identifiers, and enhanced date formats) and structural changes (such as no longer clustering multiple articles with identical metadata into a single record) to support the new capabilities.  
   - The format changes are designed to be incremental and compatible, ensuring that existing workflows can continue while enabling richer analytic opportunities.

In summary, the Proximity Context capability in GKG 2.1 improves upon GKG 1.0 by enabling the encoding of the relative positions of entities within articles, thereby allowing more nuanced contextual analysis. Alongside the new encoding of date mentions, these enhancements provide deeper insight into the relationships and temporal references in news content. At the same time, GKG 2.1 maintains backwards compatibility by preserving existing fields and allowing minimal code changes for users transitioning from version 1.0.","['adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening \nentirely new analytic opportunities.

 '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,'

Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.

 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.

However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html'
 'THE GDELT EVENT DATABASE \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.0 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their \ndescriptions.  GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, \ncapturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2.  A wide array of variables break \nout the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, \nthe Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique \narray of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both \nactors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the \nstory of each event “in flight” through the global media system. \n \nAt present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, \nhowever in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 \nformat.  The   Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note \nthat files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited).   \n \nWith the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at \nleast through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without \nmodification.  Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning \nFebruary 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches \nback to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. \n  \nThere are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset.  The first is the \ntraditional Event table.  This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several \nchanges as noted below.  In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records \nall mentions of each event.  As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those \nmentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, \nincluding the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus \nbeing buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event \nfrom that specific news report.  The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it \npossible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases.  Those wishing to find the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of \nperiod “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest \nevents with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the \nhighest Confidence measures.  This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each \nindividual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below).  It also makes it possible to \nidentify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those \nwith the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific \nsource language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).']"

Some of the most significant changes: \uf0b7 Realtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes. The GDELT Global Content Analysis Measures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment analysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual dimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, French, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Urdu). GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents and reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from LIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \uf0b7 Realtime Translation of 65 Languages. GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT Translingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine translation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, representing 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into English for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines. GDELT Translingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the very first glimpses of a world without language barriers. The GKG system now processes every news report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \uf0b7 Relevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds. A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now specify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that represents the core focus of the article. GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats including Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats. In addition, GDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to identify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded social media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is compiled. This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations anywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act as a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \uf0b7 Quotes, Names, and Amounts. The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food prices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable item. GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to offer numeric context to global events. In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing Person and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, such as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World Cup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran Nuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative. Finally, GDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the evolving language used by political leadership across the world. \uf0b7'
 '<2-hop>\n\nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 The GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were released in that format. With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has remained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of significant enhancements to the GKG system. While it was originally intended to release these new features in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these fields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and the need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical representation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to accommodate these goals. Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to the GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification. Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of special subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 compatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be supported for news content. From a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 revolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the GKG stream. Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event stream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG metadata. Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would be grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2. With the introduction of the new GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear that the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, themes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very different GCAM scores. In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture necessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level. Thus, GKG 2.1 no longer clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of extracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the GKG stream. The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering. In addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article to appear in the GKG. Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output. However, many topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy discussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a single location. This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of high relevance to many GDELT user communities. Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in the GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional scores. An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,']","The GCAM module, which provides realtime measurement of more than 2,300 emotions and themes across multiple languages, along with realtime translation of 65 languages, significantly impacted the GKG system's handling of articles in the GKG 2.1 format. Unlike the GKG 1.0 format, which clustered articles together based on shared metadata such as locations, themes, people, and organizations, the introduction of GCAM revealed that articles with identical metadata could have very different emotional and thematic scores. Therefore, GKG 2.1 no longer clusters documents with the same metadata but treats each article as a separate entry to preserve the distinct GCAM emotional assessments. Additionally, the realtime translation capability enabled identification of metadata provenance at the document level, further supporting this change. Moreover, the inclusion criteria for articles in GKG 2.1 were relaxed compared to GKG 1.0 and 2.0; previously, articles needed at least one geocoded geographic location to be included, but with GCAM's emotional scoring, articles without geographic mentions but containing emotional data are now included, broadening the scope of content captured by the GKG system.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer,"The introduction of the GDELT Global Content Analysis Measures (GCAM) system, with its realtime measurement of over 2,300 emotions and themes and realtime translation of 65 languages, significantly changed how the GKG 2.1 format handles article clustering and inclusion criteria compared to GKG 1.0 and 2.0:

1. **Article Clustering:**

   - **GKG 1.0:** Articles were clustered together if they shared the same metadata (locations, themes, people, organizations). Multiple articles with identical metadata were grouped into a single row, with a count of the number of articles (NumArticles field).
   
   - **GKG 2.1:** Due to GCAM's detailed emotional and thematic analysis, articles that might share the same locations, themes, people, and organizations could have very different GCAM scores because they use different language and emotional content. Therefore, clustering articles based solely on shared metadata was no longer appropriate.
   
   - **Change:** GKG 2.1 stopped clustering articles based on shared metadata. Instead, each article is represented as a separate entry in the GKG stream, even if multiple articles share the same metadata. This allows the system to preserve the unique emotional and thematic profile of each article as measured by GCAM.
   
   - **Additional Note:** The GKG 1.0 compatibility stream still performs clustering, but the main GKG 2.1 stream does not.

2. **Inclusion Criteria for Articles:**

   - **GKG 1.0 and 2.0:** An article had to have at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location to be included in the GKG output. This excluded many articles on topics without strong geographic references (e.g., cybersecurity, constitutional discourse).
   
   - **GKG 2.1:** With GCAM's ability to extract emotional and thematic information, the inclusion criteria were broadened. An article is included if it contains **any** successfully extracted information, including GCAM emotional scores, even if it has no geographic mentions.
   
   - **Impact:** This change allows the GKG to include a much wider range of articles, including those without geographic data but with relevant emotional or thematic content, greatly expanding the scope and relevance of the GKG data.

3. **Provenance and Translation:**

   - The realtime translation of 65 languages by GDELT Translingual required the GKG 2.1 format to track the provenance of metadata at the document level.
   
   - This is reflected in fields like `MentionDocTranslationInfo` and the unique record identifiers that indicate whether a document was machine translated.
   
   - This provenance tracking further supports the decision to treat each article as a unique entry rather than clustering.

**Summary:**

- **Clustering:** GKG 1.0 clustered articles with identical metadata; GKG 2.1 does not cluster articles, representing each article separately to preserve unique GCAM emotional and thematic profiles.

- **Inclusion:** GKG 1.0/2.0 required geographic location for inclusion; GKG 2.1 includes articles with any extracted information, including GCAM emotional scores, regardless of geographic mentions.

- **Translation and Provenance:** GKG 2.1 incorporates realtime translation metadata and document-level provenance, supporting the non-clustered, article-level granularity.

These changes, enabled by GCAM's extensive emotional and thematic analysis and realtime multilingual translation, fundamentally enhanced the GKG's ability to represent the nuanced emotional and thematic content of global news articles in realtime, expanding analytic possibilities beyond the geographic-centric approach of earlier versions.","['\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.

 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but'
 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.'
 'of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html'
 'the MentionIdentifier field above to merge the Mentions table with the GKG table to access the \ncomplete set of 2,300 emotions and themes from the GCAM system.    \n\uf0b7 \nMentionDocTranslationInfo.  (string)  This field is internally delimited by semicolons and is used \nto record provenance information for machine translated documents indicating the original \nsource language and the citation of the translation system used to translate the document for \nprocessing.  It will be blank for documents originally in English.  At this time the field will also be \nblank for documents translated by a human translator and provided to GDELT in English (such as \nBBC Monitoring materials) – in future this field may be expanded to include information on \nhuman translation pipelines, but at present it only captures information on machine translated \nmaterials.  An example of the contents of this field might be “srclc:fra; eng:Moses 2.1.1 / \nMosesCore Europarl fr-en / GT-FRA 1.0”.  NOTE:  Machine translation is often not as accurate as \nhuman translation and users requiring the highest possible confidence levels may wish to \nexclude events whose only mentions are in translated reports, while those needing the highest-\npossible coverage of the non-Western world will find that these events often offer the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or smaller-bore events of less interest to Western media.   \no SRCLC. This is the Source Language Code, representing the three-letter ISO639-2 code of \nthe language of the original source material.   \no ENG.  This is a textual citation string that indicates the engine(s) and model(s) used to \ntranslate the text.  The format of this field will vary across engines and over time and no \nexpectations should be made on the ordering or formatting of this field.  In the example \nabove, the string “Moses 2.1.1 / MosesCore Europarl fr-en / GT-FRA 1.0” indicates that \nthe document was translated using version 2.1.1 of the Moses 7 SMT platform, using the \n“MosesCore Europarl fr-en” translation and language models, with the final translation \nenhanced via GDELT Translingual’s own version 1.0 French translation and language \nmodels.  A value of “GT-ARA 1.0” indicates that GDELT Translingual’s version 1.0 Arabic \ntranslation and language models were the sole resources used for translation.  \nAdditional language systems used in the translation pipeline such as word segmentation \nsystems are also captured in this field such that a value of “GT-ZHO 1.0 / Stanford PKU” \nindicates that the Stanford Chinese Word Segmenter 8 was used to segment the text \ninto individual words and sentences, which were then translated by GDELT \nTranslingual’s own version 1.0 Chinese (Traditional or Simplified) translation and \nlanguage models. \n\uf0b7 \nExtras.

 '2\nConstructing a Knowledge Graph for GDELT\nAs previously mentioned, while the GDELT-GKG2 dataset is not actually natively in the form of a knowledge\ngraph, it is advertised and frequently cited as being one. We believe that we are making a distinct contribution\nto the research community by converting the very popular GKG2 database into a proper KG.\nGKG2 is natively a database of three related tables:\n• expert.csv captures event information;\n• GKG.csv captures article information; and\n• mentions.csv relates which articles mention which events.\nFigure 2: GDELT GKG 2.0 schema relating articles (GKG), mentions, and events (Export).\nThe database schema for these three CSV files is shown in Fig. 2 (see also [9]). The key characteristics of\nthis database relational schema should be interpreted as follows:\n• The three tables are color-coded by Events (green), Mentions (pink), and Articles (blue).\n• The single table of Events is shown in multiple green sub-tables, simply for clarity and convenience to\nlayout a long record structure.\n• Single-headed arrows represent one-to-many relationships between the tables. Specifically:\n– Each Event maps to multiple Mentions via the shared GLOBALEVENTID field.\n– Each Article maps to multiple Mentions via the DocumentIdentifer field on the Article side\nmatching to the MentionIdentifier field on the Mention side.\n• In this way, the Mentions table acts as a “pairs file” recording a many-many relation between Events\nand Articles: each event can be mentioned in multiple articles, and dually each article can men-\ntion many events. Each Article also has both a unique identifier through the GKGRECORDID or the\nDocumentIdentifer fields, since each row in the GKG data represents a single article.\n3'
 'the score of any word-count field to convert to a percentage density score.  As an example, \nassume a document with 125 words.  The General Inquirer dictionary has been assigned the \nDictionaryID of 2 and its “Bodypt” dimension has a DimensionID of 21.  SentiWordNet has a \nDictionaryID of 10 and its “Positive” dimension has a DimensionID of 1.  Thus, the V2GCAM field \nfor a document might look like “wc:125,c2.21:4,c10.1:40,v10.1:3.21111111” indicating that the \ndocument had 125 words, that 4 of those words were found the General Inquirer “Bodypt” \nlexicon, that 40 of those words were found in the SentiWordNet lexicon, and that the average \nnumeric score of all of the words found in the SentiWordNet lexicon was 3.21111111.  For a \ncomplete list of the available dimensions, along with their assigned DictionaryID and \nDimensionID codes, their assigned key, and their human name and full citation to cite that \ndimension, please see the GCAM Master Codebook. 8  NOTE: the scores for all dimensions, both \nEnglish and non-English dimensions, will be listed together in this field – please see the \ncodebooks to determine the source language of a specific dimension.  NOTE: if non-English \ndictionaries are available for a given language and generated at least one match for that \ndocument, an additional “nwc” entry will be added which reflects the word count in the native \nlanguage, since languages may have differing word counts in their native and translated forms.  \nThis count will be absent if no native dictionaries yielded a match for the document. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1SHARINGIMAGE.  (textual URL)  Many news websites specify a so-called “sharing image” for \neach article in which the news outlet manually specifies a particular image to be displayed when \nthat article is shared via social media or other formats.  Not all news outlets specify a sharing \nimage and some sites simply use their logo, but for those that do use this field, it represents the \noutlet’s selection of the single image that best captures the overall focus and contents of the \nstory.  GDELT currently recognizes a variety of formats for specifying this image, including Open \nGraph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats, among others.  \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1RELATEDIMAGES.  (semicolon-delimited list of URLs).  News articles frequently include \nphotographs, figures, and other imagery to illustrate the story, ranging from a single illustrative \nphotograph at top, to lengthy photo essays interspersed through the entirety of an article.  Such \nimagery lends a rich visual tapestry to a news report, helping to clarify, for example, whether an \narticle about a “protest blocking a highway” involves hundreds of activists along its length, or \njust a handful of people in one location, or whether a gas explosion leveled a building or merely \nshattered its windows.  GDELT uses a suite of highly sophisticated algorithms to actually “read” \nthrough each article in the way a human would, evaluating each image on to determine its \nrelevance, based on positioning, captioning, referencing, and context, and compiles a list of the \nURLs of the images it deems to be most relevant to the article.  Thus, unrelated inset boxes, \nadvertisements, and other imagery are ignored and this field contains only a list of images most \nillustrative of the core of the story.  This feature is in alpha release and involves a number of \nhighly complex algorithms working together in concert and thus may make mistakes.  We will be \nimproving this algorithm over time and would appreciate any feedback you may have on the \nkinds of images it incorrectly includes and those that it misses. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1SOCIALIMAGEEMBEDS.  (semicolon-delimited list of URLs).  News websites are increasingly \nembedding image-based social media posts inline in their articles to illustrate them with \nrealtime reaction or citizen reporting from the ground.  GDELT currently recognizes embedded \nimage-based Twitter and Instagram posts and records their URLs in this field.  Only those posts \ncontaining imagery are included in this field.  This acts as a form of social media “curation” in \nwhich news outlets are wading through the deluge of social media reaction or reporting about a \nspecific situation and hand-selecting key image posts deemed of greatest relevance, \n                                                          \n8 http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/GCAM-MASTERCODEBOOK.xlsx']"
